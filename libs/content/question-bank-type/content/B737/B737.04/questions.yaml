    The Two modes are very similar, the only difference is that ARM offers
    additional protections: 

    > - **THR HLD**: the thrust lever autothrottle servos are inhibited; the pilot
    >   can set the thrust levers manually

    This question is the centerpiece of the Type Rating. The MCP is not the source
    of truth on what modes are active. That's the FMA. The MCP green lights
    simply highlight that a mode can be deselected.

    For example:

    > N1 Switch

    >    - engages autothrottles in ARM mode.
