**Note**: This is just a summary of the FCOM content that regularly shows up in
Type Rating exams. For an overview of the systems in this chapter, check the
FCOM

## GEAR WARNING LIGHT

Illuminates red when:

- Gear is in transit
- Gear lever position disagrees with landing gear position
- Gear is not down and locked below 800ft RA with either thrust lever in idle

## LANDING GEAR TRANSFER UNIT

The landing gear retraction normally uses hydraulic system A. The landing gear
transfer unit uses hydraulic system B to aid in retraction in certain
conditions:

- Aircraft is airborne
- Engine NÂ°1 RPM is below a limiting value (engine 1 failed)
- Landing gear lever is selected up
- Either main landing gear is not up and locked

## BRAKES / AUTOBRAKES

Normal brakes use hydraulic system B for operation. If system B is not
available, alternate brakes use system A. If hydraulic system A & B are lost,
then the brake accumulator can supply limited pressure for brake operation.

Autobrake provides automatic maximum braking in the event of an RTO or
preselected braking during landing. Autobrake is only available with normal
brakes. The antiskid system is available with normal and alternate brakes.
Autobrake RTO will engage only above 90kt wheel speed.

## ANTI SKID SYSTEM

The anti-skid system prevents locked wheels by comparing the wheel speed of the
two inboard main wheels and the two outboard main wheels. When a locked
condition is sensed, brake pressure to the slower wheel is released. The
anti-locking system is available only above 25 kt.

The anti-skid system releases brake pressure to a wheel sensed in a skid
situation. Protection against hydroplaning is available for wheels 1 & 3; it is
detected when the wheel speed is 50kt below GS.
