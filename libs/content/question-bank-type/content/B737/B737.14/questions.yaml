    > With RTO selected, if the takeoff is rejected prior to wheel speed reaching 88
    > knots autobraking is not initiated, the AUTO BRAKE DISARM light does not
    > illuminate and the RTO autobrake function remains armed. If the takeoff is
    > rejected after reaching a wheel speed of 88 knots, maximum braking is applied
    > automatically when the forward thrust levers are retarded to IDLE.

    **NOTE**: Older sources will state 90kts. This has been corrected by boeing 
    to 88kts.
  variant:
    type: true-or-false
    question: With RTO selected, the system will automatically apply maximum brake
      pressure when the thrust levers have been retarded to idle with speed at
      or above 88 kts.

    question: The landing gear lights on the main centre panel all indicate green,
      but the lights on the aft overhead panel show the LEFT GEAR is not locked
      and down.   You can ignore this situation as one green light, on either
      panel, for each landing gear, means the gear is down and locked.
