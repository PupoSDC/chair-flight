    If one of the throttles EEC is in ALTN, and the other is functioning normally
    and MCT is commanded, the two EECs will eventually calculate different MCT 
    leading to a stagger in the throttles. For this reason the QRH will instruct
    to move both throttles into the HARD ALT mode.

    question: With A/T engaged, what condition could cause the throttles to be
      separated (not aligned).
