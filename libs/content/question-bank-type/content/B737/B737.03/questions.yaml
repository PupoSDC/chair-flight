    The engine cowl anti-ice valve controls the flow of air from the engine bleed
    to the engine cowl. The Engine bleed valve controls the flow of air from the
    bleeds to bleed air duct. 

    The air that flows from the bleeds can flow directly to the engine cowl 
    without passing through the engine bleed valve.
