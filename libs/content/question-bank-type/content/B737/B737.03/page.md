**Note**: This is just a summary of the FCOM content that regularly shows up in
Type Rating exams. For an overview of the systems in this chapter, check the
FCOM

## ENGINE ANTI-ICE

Engine anti-ice is taken from the 5th and 9th stages of the engine compressor,
upstream of the bleed air valve. The engine anti-ice valve is electrically
controlled and air pressure operated. Engine start switches must be selected
CONT during engine anti-ice operation.

## WING ANTI-ICE

The wing anti-ice system is a supply duct heating the three inboard slats only.
The valve system is AC operated. The valves automatically close when takeoff
(T/O) power is set during takeoff or when the duct temperature reaches 125Â°C.

## PROBE HEAT

Each probe is powered from its associated AC transfer bus. In the event of a
loss of all AC power, the captain's pitot probe is heated by the AC standby bus
(All other probes are not heated).
