## ADIRS (Air Data Inertial Reference System)

Includes:

- 2 ADIRU (Air Data Inertial Reference Unit)
- 4 ADM (Air Data Module)
- 1 ISDU (Inertial System Display Unit)
- 1 MSU (Mode Selector Unit)
- 6 Static ports (2 Capt, 2 F/O, 2 Alt)
- 3 Pitot probes
- 2 Alpha vanes
- 1 Total Air Temperature probe

A DEU (Display Electronic Unit) failure will prompt a DSPLY SOURCE message.

## PFD (Primary Flight Display) OVERVIEW

- **White Bug:**
  - T/O = Vref + 15kt
  - Approach = Vref + 20kt
- **Upper Red Band:**
  - Indicates the maximum speed as limited by VMO/MMO, gear or flap placard
    speed
- **Upper Amber Band:**
  - When flaps are up, indicates 1.3g capability to high-speed buffet
  - When flaps are extended, shows placard speed of the next logical flap
    setting
- **Lower Amber Band:**
  - Below 20,000 ft indicates 1.3g capability to stick shaker
  - Above 20,000 ft indicates 1.3g capability to low-speed buffet
  - When the airspeed decreases to the lower amber bar, the readout turns amber
    and flashes. Also, an aural alert "Airspeed low!, Airspeed low!" sounds
- **Lower Red Band:**
  - Indicates speed at which stick shaker occurs
- **Pitch Limit Indicator:**
  - Shows pitch limit to stall when flaps are extended or at low speeds
- **Expended LOC:**
  - Displayed when within 1/2 dot and 5° of MCP course

## ALERTS

- **ALT DISAGREE:**
  - Capt & F/O Altitude disagree by more than 200ft for 5 seconds
- **IAS DISAGREE:**
  - Capt & F/O IAS disagree by more than 5kt for 5 seconds
- **AOA DISAGREE:**
  - Capt & F/O AOA disagree by more than 10° for 10 seconds

## TERRAIN (On navigation display & VSD)

- **Red:**
  - Terrain is more than 2000 ft above the airplane
- **Amber:**
  - Terrain ranges from 500 ft below (250ft with gear down) to 2000ft above the
    airplane
- **Green:**
  - Terrain is more than 500 ft below (250ft with gear down) the airplan
