    When operating the stairs from the outside you need to be able to operate
    them with the battery off. This is necessary for a scenario where the Aircraft
    is cold and dark and the battery switch is OFF. For this reason, exceptionally,
    the **External** Airstair operation switch bypasses the main battery switch.

    When operating the stairs from the inside, you need to have the battery switch
    ON. There is no need for a weird bypass.
