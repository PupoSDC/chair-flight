## OVERVIEW

Bleed air supplies the following systems:

- Air conditioning
- Pressurization
- Engine/Wing Anti-ice
- Engine Starting
- Hydraulic tank pressurization
- Water tank pressurization

Bleed air is supplied normally by the engine 5th stage low-pressure area,
additionally 9th when demand is high. Any overpressure or overtemperature will
cause the valve to close and illuminate the BLEED TRIP OFF light. Duct Pressure
is measured after the bleed air valve and before the pack valve.

## ISOLATION VALVE

Three positions:

- **Close:** Isolates both sides of the bleed air system
- **Auto:** Opens the valve if any bleed or pack switches are moved to OFF;
  otherwise, the valve is closed
- **Open:** Isolation valve is open

## OUTFLOW VALVE

Cabin pressurization is controlled by the outflow valve. Maximum differential
pressure is 9.1 psi. The outflow valve can be controlled by 3 DC motors, 2
automatically controlled and 1 manually controlled. There are 2 positive
pressure relief valves and one negative pressure relief valve.

## PACKS

Air from the left pack is supplied to the flight deck, and any excess air is
returned to the mix manifold. Air from the right pack supplies the mix manifold.
The mix manifold air is then passed through the trim air system and distributed
to the forward and aft cabin. Trim air is used to adjust zone temperatures in
the flight deck, forward cabin, and aft cabin.

If a pack is not operating, the other pack will regulate in high flow (except on
the ground or in-flight with flaps extended). If a pack fails or is turned off,
the other pack will produce air to satisfy the coolest zone temperature demand.
If the trim air system fails, each pack will operate in isolation of the other.

## RECIRCULATION FANS

Recirculation fans reduce the load on the air conditioning system. Air from the
cabin and E&E bay is drawn and circulated around the cargo bay before being
filtered and returned to the mix manifold.

## GROUND AIR SUPPLY

- Ground air conditioning: Feeds into the mix manifold, temperature control from
  the ground unit.
- External air cart: Feeds into the pneumatic bay, permits engine air start,
  temperature can be controlled in the flight deck.
