### Ideal turbine cycle

The ideal turbine cycle is known as Brayton cycle. All ideal cycles consist of 4
steps, usually in a cyclic sequence of Compression -> Combustion -> Expansion ->
Cooling.

This ideal cycle is however drastically different from a real cycle.

- The cooling part of an ideal cycle does not really exist in a real engine.
  After the the expansion stage the air is released onto the atmosphere
- In the ideal Brayton cycle the energy used in the combustion is the same
  energy that is recouped by the cooling process.
- In the ideal Brayton cycle the only source of power results from the
  difference between the power required at the compressor and the power
  available in the turbine.

That being said, what makes the brayton cycle unique, and different from Diesel
and otto cycle, is that combustion is done at constant pressure (and not
constant volume).

### Free Power Turbine

> A free-turbine turboshaft is a form of turboshaft or turboprop gas turbine
> engine where the power is extracted from the exhaust stream of a gas turbine
> by an independent turbine, downstream of the gas turbine. The power turbine is
> not mechanically connected to the turbines that drive the compressors, hence
> the term "free", referring to the independence of the power output shaft (or
> spool). This is opposed to the power being extracted from the
> turbine/compressor shaft via a gearbox.

  <Explanation>
    ### Power related parameters * EGT, Gas generator speed, HP spool speed are
    all related to the current power level of the engine. * If power increases,
    all these values increase. If power decreases, all these values decrease. *
    Changing RPM has no effect in these parameters. ### RPM related parameters *
    Free power turbine speed is directly coupled with propeller speed. *
    Changing power has no effect in the free power turbine speed. * Increasing
    RPM directly increases Free power turbine speed. ### "Shared" parameters *
    Increasing power at constant RPM increases blade angle. * Increasing RPM at
    constant power decreases blade angle.
