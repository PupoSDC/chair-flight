### Bands of Frequencies

| Full Name                | Abbreviation | Range          |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| very low frequency       | VLF          | 3-30 kHz;      |
| low frequency            | LF           | 30-300 kHz;    |
| medium frequency         | MF           | 300-3 000 kHz; |
| high frequency           | HF           | 3-30 MHz;      |
| very high frequency      | VHF          | 30-300 MHz;    |
| ultra-high frequency     | UHF          | 300-3 000 MHz; |
| super high frequency     | SHF          | 3-30 GHz;      |
| extremely high frequency | EHF          | 30-300 GHz.    |

**Suggestion**: Memorize 30-300 MHz for VHF, which is the range of frequencies
most used in aviation. You can then just remind yourself that each range is 10
times higher or lower.

### ITU abbreviations

- N0N: carrier without modulation as used by non-directional radio beacons
  (NDBs);

- A1A: carrier with keyed Morse code modulation as used by NDBs;

- A2A: carrier with amplitude modulated Morse code as used by NDBs;

- A3E: carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for communication (VHF-COM).

- Fist Letter: Method of modulation

  - N -> No modulation
  - A -> Amplitude modulation

- Second Number: Type/Nature of the signals modulating the main carrier

  - 0 -> No Modulation (N0)
  - 1 ->
  - 2 ->
  - 3 -> Modulated speech

- Third Letter: Type/Nature of Information being transmitted
  - N -> No information
  - A -> Aural telegraphy, intended to be decoded by hear (i.e.: Morse code)
  - E -> Voice communications

### SSB

SSB is a form of amplitude modulation that allows for more efficient use of
bandwidth at a cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning to
the frequency. It is used for:

- VOLMET
- HF two way communication
