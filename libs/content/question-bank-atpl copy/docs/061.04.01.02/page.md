### Chart vs Earth convergence

Earth meridian convergence is the difference in inclination between two
meridians on the earth or the change in true track (direction) of a **great
circle** between two meridians on the earth.

Chart meridian convergence is the difference in inclination between two
meridians on a chart or the change in true track (direction) of a **straight
line** between two meridians on a chart.
