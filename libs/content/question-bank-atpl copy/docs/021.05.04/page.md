- **PFC**: Primary Flight Computer. Receives Pilot commands, checks them for
  viability and errors, and converts them into the final digital signal to be
  sent to the **ACE**.
- **ACE**: Actuator Control Electronics. Recieves a digital signal from the
  **PFC** and converts it into an analogue signal to be sent to the **PCU**.
- **PCU**: Power Control Unit. Receives electric analogue and activates an
  Hydraulic actuator

    A Fly by Wire system is always irreversible because...
  </Text>
  <Option correct>
    The link between the pilot inputs and control surfaces is done indirectly
    via a computer
  </Option>
  <Option>
    A pilot can reverse the inputs of the autopilot system as they also have a
    direct link to the hydraulic actuators of the control surfaces
  </Option>
  <Option>
    it is linked mechanically to a computer and then to the flight control
    surfaces
  </Option>
  <Option>
    the flight computer simulates the feedback of the control surface movement
    by applying a resistance force on the sidestick

  <Option

    Used throughout the entire flight from the chocks off to chocks on. It

    transition between each other automatically.

  <Option

    why="Secondary Mode is the Boeing equivalent to Airbus' Alternate Law"
  >
    A reduced mode of operation that is activated on deterioration of the
    fly-by-wire system. Most protections will remain active, while some will be
    replaced by warnings to the pilot.
  </Option>
  <Option
    subject={[["Direct Law"]]}
    why="This is an 'airbus only' mode. NOTE: this is not part of the LO's"
  >
    In this mode all protections are lost. The flight control movements are
    directly proportional to sidestick inputs.

  <Option

    why="This is an 'airbus only' mode. NOTE: this is not part of the LO's"

    In this mode control via primary control surfaces is not possible, and the
    aircraft is controlled by the stabilizer trim system and rudder pedals only.

    A reduced mode of operation that activates in the most uneventful portions
