  {
    "question": "What is induced drag?",
    "answer": "Induced drag and its wing tip vortices are a direct consequence of the creation of lift by the wing.\n\nSince the Coefficient of Lift is large when the Angle of Attack is large, induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the speed whereas all other drag is directly proportional to the square of the speed.\n\nThe effect of this is that induced drag is relatively unimportant at high speed in the cruise and descent where it probably represents less than 10% of total drag. In the climb, it is more important representing at least 20% of total drag. At slow speeds just after take off and in the initial climb, it is of maximum importance and may produce as much as 70% of total drag.\n\nFinally, when looking at the potential strength of wing tip vortices, all this theory on induced drag must be moderated by the effect of aircraft weight. Induced drag will always increase with aircraft weight.",

The length of the clearway may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available (Take Off Distance Available (TODA)).

    "answer": "The critical engine of a multi-engine, fixed-wing propeller-driven aircraft is the one whose failure would result in the most adverse effects on the aircraft's handling and performance.\n\nDue to the asymmetric blade effect (P-factor), the right-hand engine typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's C.G. than the left-hand engine.\n\nThe failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger yaw effect via the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice-versa, and it is termed the Critical Engine. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a stronger yaw moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control. Thus, the failure of the critical (left-hand) engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine.\n\nThe operating right-hand engine will produce a more severe yaw towards the dead engine, thus making the failure of the left-hand engine critical.",

    "question": "Explain the Fohn wind.",
    "answer": "A Fohn wind is a warm dry wind that blows down the lee side of a mountain.\n\nInitially, the air temperature cools dry-adiabatically (3°C/1000 ft), until its dew point temperature is reached. Condensation occurs as the air is further forced up the mountain range, resulting in the air cooling saturated-adiabatically (generally considered in the mid-latitudes to be 1.8°C/1000 ft). Clouds and precipitation form. When the air mass reaches the top of the mountain range it has lost a significant amount of its water content and so has a much lower dew point temperature.\n\nAs the air then begins to descend down the lee slope of the mountain the compressed air is initially heated saturated-adiabatically, and in effect the direct reverse to the cooling effect on the windward side occurs. As the air continues leeward and downward from the mountain range, the air, now no longer saturated, is heated dry-adiabatically.\n\nThe resultant wind is dry and warm giving clear conditions at airfields on the lee side of the mountain range.\n\nThe Foehn Effect also may be associated with mountain wave activity.",

    "answer": "Those are contrails.\n\nThe jet engine exhaust gases consist of carbon dioxide and water vapour.\n\nAt high altitudes the wator vapour gets released in a very cold environment. This can cause the air to be saturated with water vapour and then condenses. If cold enough the condense can freeze into white droplets. This forms the contrails.",

    "question": "How does an ILS work?",
    "answer": "An ILS (Instrument Landing System) is defined as a precision runway approach aid based on two radio beams which together provide pilots with both vertical and horizontal guidance during an approach to land.\n\nThe ILS aerials transmit two lobes. For a pilot on final, the lobe to his right is modulated at a frequency of 150 Hz and the one to his left at 90 Hz. The point where the lobes meet is the centre line of the runway. As the signals on the lobe move from the centre line to either side, their amplitude increases. This means the magnitude of their depth modulation increases. The depth modulation can be considered as a percentage. For example, if an aircraft receives a 15% depth modulated signal from the left and a 5% depth modulated signal from the right, the difference of modulation becomes 10% to the left. This electrical imbalance is sent to the aircraft and the localizer needle is designed in such a way that it will show a deflection to the opposite direction, telling the pilot to go to the right.\n\nWhen on the centre line, the modulation difference is zero and the needle centres itself.\n\nThe glide slope or the glide path provides the pilot with vertical guidance. The glide slope is set such that a glide slope angle of 3 degrees is maintained by the pilot. The needle of the slope moves up, if the aircraft is too low and moves down if it is too much above the required path. The glide slope is on the UHF band (329.15 - 335 Mhz).\n\nThe glide slope operates the same way as the localizer. The only difference is that the lobes are emitted on the vertical plane. The upper lobe is modulated at 90 Hz while the bottom one at 150 Hz. Exactly the same way as before, the needle of the slope moves based on the difference in depth modulation. As like before when the modulation difference is nil, the glide needle moves to the very centre of the instrument.",
