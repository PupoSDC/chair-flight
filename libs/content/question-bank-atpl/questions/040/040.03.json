The controller’s reply was “OK, stand by for take-off”; however, the KLM crew only received the “OK” part as the rest of the sentence was cut off by a simultaneous transmission from another aircraft on the same frequency (interference). The KLM captain interpreted the “OK” as a take-off clearance and started his take-off run.
