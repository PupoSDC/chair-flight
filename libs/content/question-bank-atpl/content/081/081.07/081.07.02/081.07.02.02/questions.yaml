      Which of the following statements are true regarding feathering a
      propeller after an engine failure?


      1\. Drag and yaw are increased for multi-engine aircraft.   

      2\. The gliding distance is increased for single-engine aircraft.   

      3\. Yaw is reduced for single-engine aircraft.   

      4\. The engine-out flight performance is improved for multi-engine aircraft.

      Which of the following statements are correct with regard to a windmilling
      propeller on a twin-engine aeroplane?


      1\. Feathering the propeller may be delayed since windmilling produces more thrust than drag.   

      2\. The aeroplane decelerates due to the propeller drag from the failed engine.   

      3\. The yawing moment is intensified due to the propeller drag from the failed engine.   

      4\. Low speed controllability of the aeroplane is increased due to increased stability.   

      5\. Wing lift distribution varies due to airflow disturbance behind the propeller on the failed engine.   

      6\. The glide performance of the aeroplane is improved due to the increased L/D ratio.
