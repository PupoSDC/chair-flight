    question: An aeroplane is on final approach at a CAS within the non-stable
      region of the CAS/drag graph. The aeroplane experiences a change in the
      wind direction to be less of a headwind with little change in wind speed.
      This condition will cause...

    question: An aeroplane on final approach is flying at a CAS lower than VMD,
      which means it is speed unstable. If the speed suddenly decreases, what
