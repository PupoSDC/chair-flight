    question: |-
      Consider a jet transport aircraft flying in icing conditions, which two statements below are correct with regards to unexpected stalls?

      1\. The pitot and static ports can become frozen over causing a lack of information to the ADC and subsequently a lack of warning to the pilots when the critical AoA is reached.   
       2\. The large amount of ice forming on the tail plane causes an increase in mass and thus an uncontrollable pitch up.   
       3\. The flow-back ice forming on the wings will decrease the critical AoA leading to an unexpected stall.   
       4\. Ice formation on the main fuselage body will be more critical in causing a stall vs ice formation on the wings.

      correct or incorrect?
    firstCorrectStatements:
      - Assuming no flow separation, the strength of wing tip vortices decreases
        as the angle of attack decreases.
    firstIncorrectStatements:
      - Assuming no flow separation, the strength of wing tip vortices increases
        as the angle of attack decreases.
    secondCorrectStatements:
      - The strength of wing tip vortices is affected by aspect ratio.
    secondIncorrectStatements:
      - The strength of wing tip vortices is not affected by aspect ratio.
