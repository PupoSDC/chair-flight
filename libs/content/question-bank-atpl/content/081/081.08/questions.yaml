    question: An aircraft is flying the intermediate approach phase of an arrival at
      a speed of 90 kt with the flaps in the approach position. The pilot
      extends the landing gear and lowers the nose to follow the glide path

      final approach path to the runway. The pilot notices that the aircraft can
      maintain a speed of 90 kt WITHOUT needing to adjust the thrust setting.

      The annex illustrates an aeroplane suffering an engine failure, while flying at the normal cruising speed. After dealing appropriately with the failure, the pilot prepares the aeroplane for landing. The pilot maintains wings level as the aeroplane is slowing down; as the airspeed decreases, larger variations in rudder input are required to maintain direction, even if thrust remains constant. One reason for this is because the…

      A twin-engine turboprop aeroplane has an engine failure in flight. Select the correct statements with regard to the asymmetric effects of the propeller slipstream.

      1\. Slipstream-induced lift will be lost on the side with the failed engine.   
      2\. A rolling moment towards the live engine will be induced.   
      3\. Total lift will be reduced, giving a tendency to descend.   
      4\. Use of leading edge devices can counter the effects of lost slipstream.
