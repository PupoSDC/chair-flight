      Consider the following statements about VMCG:

      1\. VMCG is determined with the gear down.   
      2\. VMCG is determined with the flaps in the landing position.   
      3\. VMCG is determined by using rudder and nosewheel steering.   
      4\. During VMCG determination the aeroplane may not deviate from the straight-line path by more than 30 ft.

      The combination that regroups all of the correct statements is:

    question: How does VMCG change with increasing field elevation and temperature?
    options:
      - id: OFEWZK10L
        text: decreases, because VMCG is expressed in IAS, which decreases with constant
          TAS and decreasing density.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: O1S5RKIPT
        text: increases, because VMCG is related to V1 and VR and those speeds increase
          if the density decreases.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: ONNVI1BND
        text: increases, because at a lower density a larger IAS is necessary to
          generate the required rudder force.

      - id: O9FRQRULN
