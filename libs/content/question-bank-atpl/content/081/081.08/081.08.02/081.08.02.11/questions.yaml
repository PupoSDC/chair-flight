          decrease, due to less thrust being developed by the engines, and therefore
          control being able to be maintained at a lower CAS.
        correct: true

          increase, due to the loss of effectiveness of flight controls for a given
          angle of deflection, and the need for a higher CAS to maintain
          control.
