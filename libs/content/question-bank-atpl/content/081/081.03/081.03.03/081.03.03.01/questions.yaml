    question: A jet engine aeroplane is cruising close to its maximum altitude when
      it suffers an engine failure. While concentrating on completing the
      appropriate checklist, the pilots fail to notice the aeroplane’s speed
      decreasing. The aeroplane develops buffeting, which eventually becomes
      strong enough to be considered a deterrent. This means that the aircraft
      is…

      Thunderstorms are reported in the vicinity of an aerodrome when a heavy jet transport is about to commence an approach. Which combination of these methods could be used by the crew to mitigate the risk of buffet or stall?

      1\. Delay the approach, and divert if necessary.   
       2\. Plan a flapless approach and landing.   
       3\. Maintain a speed at least 30 kts above normal approach speed.   
       4\. Delay landing flap selection until 200 ft.   
       5\. Expect and prepare for a windshear warning and a go-around.
