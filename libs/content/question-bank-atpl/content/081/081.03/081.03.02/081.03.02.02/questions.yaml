    question: Regarding the Buffet Onset Boundary Chart in the annexe, which of
      these statements are correct or incorrect?
    firstCorrectStatements:
      - The maximum altitude that can be achieved with respect to buffet onset,
        according to Certification Specifications, is higher at M = 0.82 than at
        M = 0.75.
    firstIncorrectStatements:
      - The maximum altitude that can be achieved with respect to buffet onset,
        according to Certification Specifications, is lower at M = 0.82 than at
        M = 0.75.
    secondCorrectStatements:
      - Flying at M = 0.84 provides the optimal margin with respect to buffet
        onset.
    secondIncorrectStatements:
      - Flying at M = 0.84 does not provide the optimal margin with respect to
        buffet onset.
