      The pilot of a light aeroplane is flying at a speed below the normal
      cruising speed, in a gentle turn to allow a passenger to look at something
      interesting on the ground. Which of the following might occur to warn the
      pilot that the aircraft is approaching the stall?


      1\. Heavy buffet of the elevator before approaching the stall,   
       2\. Significant pitch-up of the nose immediately before the stall,   
       3\. The audible stall warning sounds,   
       4\. The controls become light and less effective close to but before the stall.

      A pilot is flying an aeroplane whose clean configuration stall speed is 60
      kt. While cruising at 95 kt the pilot has to take avoiding action against
      another aeroplane.   
       The pilot banks the aeroplane sharply and during this manoeuvre, the aeroplane stalls.   
       Why did the aeroplane stall at 95 kt?

      A “stall warning” can be produced synthetically by electronic means, by a
      system that may malfunction. What are the natural stall warnings
      confirming an approaching stall?


      (1) Aerodynamic buffeting   
       (2) Increased aileron effectiveness   
       (3) Inability to arrest a rate of descent   
       (4) Stick pusher activation
