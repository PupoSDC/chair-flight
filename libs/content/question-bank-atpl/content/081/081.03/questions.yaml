    question: Which of these statements about the effect of wing sweep on centre of
      pressure location are correct or incorrect?
    firstCorrectStatements:
      - The centre of pressure on an unswept wing moves aft as the angle of
        attack approaches and exceeds the critical angle of attack.
    firstIncorrectStatements:
      - The centre of pressure on an unswept wing moves forward as the angle of
        attack approaches and exceeds the critical angle of attack.
    secondCorrectStatements:
      - When sweep back increases, the centre of pressure has an increased
        tendency to move forward as the angle of attack approaches and exceeds
        the critical angle of attack.
    secondIncorrectStatements:
      - When sweep back increases, the centre of pressure has an increased
        tendency to move aft as the angle of attack approaches and exceeds the
        critical angle of attack.

    question: >-
      During training flights, it is normal to demonstrate accelerated stalls.
      These are carried out at speeds below 90kt and are induced by using
      excessive stick inputs to pull up during stall recovery. Spiral dives are
      also manoeuvres which are demonstrated during training flights. In this
      case, as the spiral dive develops, the speed is allowed to increase to
      130kt. Considering the aeroplane limitations given below, which statement
      is correct?


      VS: 45 kt   
       VA: 100 kt
