    question:
      Using conventional flight controls, you are manually piloting a jet
      transport aircraft as you decelerate from M0.76 to M0.73\. A supercritical
      wing design is used on the aircraft. To maintain altitude as the plane
      decelerates, you must continuously apply a small nose-down trim. As you
      decrease your speed through M 0.73, you find that there is a need for
      progressive nose-up trim. This could have several causes, including...
