    question: A modern jet transport aeroplane is cruising at 35000 ft in an area of
      mountain waves. The cruising speed is at M 0.79 with MMO at M 0.81 when
      the aeroplane suddenly experiences a positive wind shear. The autothrust
      is slow at reacting and the aeroplane reaches a speed of M 0.82 before
      starting to decelerate again. Apart from an overspeed warning, are there
      any other indications of the overspeed that may be apparent to the pilots?
