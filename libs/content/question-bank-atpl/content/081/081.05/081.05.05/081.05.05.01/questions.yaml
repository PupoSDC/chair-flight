    options:
      - id: O7KEAQXW0
        text:
          yawing motion generated by rudder deflection causes a speed increase of
          the outer wing, which increases the lift on that wing so that the
          aeroplane starts to roll in the same direction as the yaw.
        correct: true

          yawing motion generated by rudder deflection causes a speed increase of
          the inner wing, which increase the lift on that wing so that the
          aeroplane starts to roll in the same direction as the yaw.
