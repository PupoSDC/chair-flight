    question: A transport aircraft has to carry some heavy cargo aft of the CG
      location. The cargo would ideally be placed further forwards within the
      aircraft, but it is very difficult to move. The Captain verifies that the
      aircraft is within CG limits currently, and continues with the flight
      preparation. What is the effect on stick force stability and how does the
      leading edge of the variable-incidence horizontal stabiliser move due to
      this cargo?
