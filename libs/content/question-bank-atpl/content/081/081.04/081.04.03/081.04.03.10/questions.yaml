    question: "The Pilot of a light cargo aircraft has loaded a heavy piece of
      freight in the cargo bay. Due To the loading position, the centre of
      gravity is on the aft limit but moving the freight forward is difficult.
      Compared to a centre of gravity located in a more mid-position, the pilot
      will find that the stick- force stability is:"
