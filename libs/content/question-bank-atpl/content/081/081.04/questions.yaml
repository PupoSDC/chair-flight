    question: Preparing to make a flight in a B737, you notice that the yaw damper
      is INOP, and after consulting the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), you see
      that flight without the yaw damper is restricted to not above FL170\. Why
      does this restriction exist?

    question: An aeroplane is equipped with 2 basic yaw dampers that operate
      independently of the flight controls. Due to a hydraulic leak, one of the
      yaw dampers becomes unserviceable. The aeroplane is allowed to fly as long
      as one yaw damper is operational, however the pilots must not commence
      flight if both yaw dampers are unserviceable. Why must the aeroplane have
      at least one serviceable yaw damper?

    question: >-
      A large jet aircraft is designed to be operated with a positive
      longitudinal stability and is equipped with a Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system.
      Prior to each flight, the pilots input the aircraft mass and CG location
      into the Flight Management System (FMS). The aircraft's FMS then informs
      the FBW system of this data, allowing for the correct control forces and
      limitations to be used, giving flight envelope protection and ensuring
      stability is maintained.


      Consider what will happen to the aircraft's high altitude handling characteristics if the pilot inputs the INCORRECT CG position into the FMS, located forward of the actual CG position. Which of the following statements is correct?
    options:
      - id: O9WKEXRSS
