    question: |-
      At 16:12 UTC a pilot turns overhead "KOK" VOR/DME onto a heading 327°(M) to track the 320° radial at a TAS of 140 kt and a calculated ground speed of 158 kt.The pilot takes a fix from KOK at 16:42, and is on VOR radial 323º at 79.5 nm DME distance.

      If the aircraft has been flown accurately on the selected heading and speed, and given the following conditions, what is the probable reason for the difference between the DR position and the fix at 16:42?

      A pilot is planned to fly a track of 270°(T) towards ZVR VOR. At 10:20 UTC they plot their position and determine that they are on course. At 10:32 UTC, after having travelled for 60 NM, the pilot plots their position again and finds themselves 10 NM off-track towards the forecast wind. Given the following information, calculate their average drift from 10:20 UTC to 10:32 UTC.

    question: A pilot is flying VFR in VMC at 1 500 ft above ground, passing small
      separated villages. The pilot chose a church tower in such a village as a
      turning point for a new course. After completing the turn and flying
      towards the next waypoint, which is shown on the chart as a framework
      tower, the pilot is not able to find this tower at the expected time
      overhead. What is a likely reason for this navigation error?
