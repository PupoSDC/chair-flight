## Converting Units

There are three ways of doing this. All of them are equally valid, and we
recommend you mastering the 3 of them. Practice makes perfect. Make sure to try
all of these approaches to answer questions until you can use either of them in
an almost automated way.

### Precise conversions.

- 1 NM = 1.852 km
- 1 SM = 1.609 km
- 1 m = 3.28 ft
- 1 ft = 12 inches

### Approximations.

If you are not a fan of mental arithemetics or convoluted menemonics you can
consider skipping this method and focusing on memorizing the other 2 methods.

There are several "rule of thumb" approximations for these conversations. These
are usually good enough for you to exclude wrong answers immediatly simply
because they are not even close to the correct answer. Knowing these is also
great if you find yourself in the cockpit and need to do some rough estimations.

#### NM to km

> Multiply by 2 and reduce 10%

i.e.: **5 NM**, you multiply by 2 and get **10**. **10%ª** of 10 is **1**.
**10 - 1 = 9**. 5 NM is about 9 km. (precise answer: 9.26)

You can reverse this operation for the opposite conversion:

i.e.: **7km**, you sum 10%, to get about **8**, devide by 2 and you get **4**. 7
km is about 4NM (precise answer: 3.78).

As an even rougher estimation, remember that **1 NM is slightly less than 2
km**.

#### ft to meter

> 3 is 1, 6 is 2, 10 is 3

- **3000 ft = 1000m**, This is the basic idea. you simplify that 1m = 3ft
- **6000 ft = 2000m**, you keep the simplification: 1m = 3ft
- **10000 ft = 3000m**, Instead of increasing 1000m at 90000ft you "wait" for
  10.000ft.

For more complex operations you just split the distance in blocks of "3 and 10".
And then add some "magic poweder" to compensate for the remainer:

- **27.000ft = 2 \* 10.000 + 6.000 + something = 6000m + 2000m + something =
  8500m**,

This approximation still works the other way around, but the head arithmatics
are a bit more convoluted.

- **1000 meters = 3000ft**, You multiply by 3. (Correct: 3280)
- **2000 meters = 6000ft**, You multiply by 3. (Correct: 6562)
- **3000 meters = 10.000ft**, You multiply by 3 again, but since its the third
  time you add 1000. (9842m)
- **7000 meters = 10.000 ft + 10.000ft + 3.000ft = 23.000ft**, Every 3000 m are
  10.000 ft, and the last 1000m is only "3000ft"
