The Artic circle is at 66 degrees 33 minutes North. Higher than this latitude
during the Winter months the Sun will not be seen and a state of continuous
night or twilight exists.

If The Sun is at a celestial latitude of 90 degrees then it is directly over the
subject's head.\
This can occur only within the tropical band of latitude between 23 degrees 27 minutes
North and 23 degrees 27 minutes South

    The angle between the plane of the ecliptic and the plane of equator is

  <Option>27.5º</Option>
  <Option>25.3º</Option>
  <Option>66.5º</Option>
  <Option correct>23.5º</Option>

  <Explanation>
    The ecliptic is the annual path of the apparent Sun around the celestial
    sphere. The Earth's vertical axis is tilted by 23 degrees 27 minutes from
    the vertical. A line drawn from the Sun will differ from the plane of the
    Earth's equator by 23 degrees 27 minutes.
