      A pilot is performing a VFR flight just under the low cloud base following the route above, and at Fruges Windfarm, they get cleared to fly directly to DET VOR/DME. While flying directly towards DET VOR/DME, they realise at 15:00 that the on-board GPS equipment has been showing unreliable indications for a few minutes and the pilot becomes unsure of their position. Which of the following should the pilot do in this case?

      1\. Tune in to the DET VOR/DME frequency if within radio range.  
      2\. Climb to a higher level to increase radio range.  
      3\. Follow the calculated heading towards DET VOR/DME.  
      4\. Follow the flight legs according to the operational flight plan.

      Refer to figure.

      (For this question use VFR chart ED-4 from the Jeppesen GSPRM 2017). An aircraft is flying a VFR flight from STRUNKOVICE airport (LKSR, N49°05.0' E14°04.5') to REGENSBURG OBERHUB airport (EDNR, N49° 08.5' E012° 04.9') via VILSHOFEN airport (EDMV, N48°38.1′, E13°11.7′) and the mast of 1848 ft next to MALLERSDORF. Due to inattention of the pilot, he/she drifted to the right and confused ELSENTHAL-GRAFENAU airport (EDNF, N48º49.4',E013º22.0') for VILSHOFEN airport turning earlier right on the correct heading. When the pilot saw the mast with an elevation of 3750 ft, he/she started to doubt his/her position. What is the best action to take?
