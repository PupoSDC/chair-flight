      When flying a VFR map-reading exercise, the pilot becomes lost because of
      isolated patches of fog hindering the ability to accurately pin-point
      his/her position. Which of the following should the pilot do in this
      situation ?


      1\. Maintain visual contact with the ground.   
       2\. Communicate, if in contact with an Air Traffic Control (ATC) unit, to request assistance.   
       3\. Fly a series of expanding circles to find a suitable check point.   
       4\. Look at the terrain for hills and valleys or line features such as a motorway, railway, river or coastline.   
       5\. Read the map from map to ground.
