    question: An aircraft is used for Commercial Air Transport. Since the aircraft's
      initial entry into service, 3 years ago, several repairs and modifications

      When must the operator ensure an aircraft is weighed?


      1) On initial entry into service.   
       2) If the mass and balance records have not been adjusted for alterations or modification.   
       3) Every 48 months after initial weighing, unless "Fleet Masses" are utilized by the operator.   
       4) If the cumulative change in CG position exceeds ± 0.5% of the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)   
       5) Whenever the cumulative changes to the Dry Operating Mass (DOM) exceed ± 0.5% of the Maximum Landing Mass (MLM).
