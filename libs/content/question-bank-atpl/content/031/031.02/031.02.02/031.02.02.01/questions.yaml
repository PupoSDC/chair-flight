      Which one of the statements below are correct regarding the Maximum Zero
      Fuel Mass (MZFM)?


      1\. Is a regulatory limitation.   
       2\. Is calculated for a maximum load factor of +3.5 g.   
       3\. Is based on the maximum permissible bending moment at the wing root.   
       4\. Is defined on the assumption that fuel is consumed from the outer wings tank first.   
       5\. Is defined on the assumption that fuel is consumed from the centre wing tank first.

    question: You are flying in a twin-engine piston aeroplane with a maximum
      structural landing mass of 4 700 kg on a very hot and humid summer day.
      Your performance-limited landing mass on this particular flight is equal
      to 4 300 kg. Assuming that you did NOT burn the 30 kg of contingency fuel
      that you had loaded prior to departure, what is your regulated landing
      mass?

    question: The flight manual states that the Maximum Structural Landing Mass of
      your aircraft is 5300 kg. For a flight terminating in a hot desert area,
      the density altitude for the day concerned restricts the landing mass to
      4900 kg. If the contingency fuel of 30 kg has NOT been used, what is the
      regulated landing mass?
