    question:
      An aeroplane, with its CG limits from 638 inches to 658 inches aft of
      the datum, should have been loaded so as to give a calculated Take-Off
      Mass of 64 200 kg and the CG located at 640 inches aft of the datum, with
      750 kg loaded into the front cargo hold and 500 kg into the rear cargo
      hold. Unfortunately, the ground staff incorrectly loaded all the cargo
      into the forward cargo hold. If the distance between the cargo holds is
      517 inches, is the aeroplane's CG within limits?
