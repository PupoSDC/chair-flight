      An aircraft had a total mass of 5 430 kg with a CG of 5.43 m aft of the
      datum line. After calculations, to return the CG within limits, an
      additional ballast of 210 kg was loaded. The aircraft's new CG is 5.56 m
      aft of the datum.   
       Determine where the additional ballast was loaded:

      An aircraft has three holds situated at 20 in, 120 in and 240 in aft
      of the datum, identified as holds A,B and C respectively. The total
      aircraft mass is 4 900 kg and the CG is 50 in aft of the datum. The CG
      limits are from 35 in to 65 in aft of the datum. How much load must be
      removed from hold C to ensure that the CG is positioned on the forward
      limit?

      An aircraft has 100 lb of ballast installed in the forward cargo hold
      located 22.5 inches aft of the datum. The load and balance calculation
      gives a TOM of 4 000 lb, and the CG at 85 inches aft of the datum.


      What should the pilot do to the ballast to move the CG to 86 inches aft of the datum?
