      An aircraft carrying wild animals, has four small cargo bays available
      for an animal cage. In favor of a wildlife operation, a caged wild animal
      of 144.75 kg has to be transported. Before loading the wild animal, the
      aircraft had initially a Take-off Mass of 6224.25 kg and a CG positioned
      9.8 m aft of the datum. So as to displace the CG 9.9 m aft of datum, at
      which cargo bay must the animal be loaded?

      An aircraft has a total mass of 7 220 kg with a CG of 4.16 m aft of
      the datum line. A few minutes before dispatch, an additional load of 170
      kg is loaded onto the aircraft. With the aircraft's new CG at 4.31 m,
      where should the additional load be placed?

      aft of the datum. The centre of gravity is 5 in behind the aft limit. To
      move the CG to the aft limit, 950 kg is removed from the aft baggage
      compartment, which is located 200 in behind datum. What is the aircraft
      NEW weight?
