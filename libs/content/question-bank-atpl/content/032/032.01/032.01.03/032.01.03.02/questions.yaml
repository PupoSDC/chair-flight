    question: |-
      An aeroplane is flying westwards over the middle of the Alps when it suffers an engine failure. The operator has defined two possible escape routes from the area, both of equal distance and terrain profile. In order to maximise terrain clearance, which escape route should the pilot take, and what speed should they descend at?

      1\. Escape route North, with a tailwind.  
      2\. Escape route South, with a headwind.  
      3\. Descend at high speed (close to VMO, maximum operating limit speed).  
      4\. Descend at low speed (close to VMD, minimum drag speed).

    question: A large jet transport aeroplane is cruising at the Long Range Cruise
      speed (LRC). A deviation of +/- 1000 ft from the LRC optimum altitude
      leads to 2.5% change in specific range. The specific range will change by
      (1) \_\_\_\_\_ if flying 1000 ft above the optimum altitude, and by (2)
      \_\_\_\_\_ if flying 2000 ft below the optimum altitude.
