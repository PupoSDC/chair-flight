      A flight has been planned to operate at the maximum field-length limited take-off mass (FLLTOM). This was based upon the planned runway being 04 and the forecast wind to be light and variable. During the taxi, an aircraft just ahead was cleared to take-off and the reported wind was 270° (M)/20 kt. What observations should the flight crew raise given this updated wind?
    options:
      - id: ORW3T57G9
        text:
          The departure can be continued because the planned take-off mass is based

          The take-off can be commenced because the updated wind means that the new
