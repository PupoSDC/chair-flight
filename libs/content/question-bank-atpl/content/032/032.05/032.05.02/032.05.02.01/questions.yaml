      Refer to figure or CAP 698, figure 4.23.  
      Owing to some last-minute airspace closures, a passenger flight over southern Europe has been re-routed from its normal flight plan. The flight crew have noticed that the primary en-route diversion would require a one-engine-inoperative net level-off altitude of 16 000 ft to stay above the highest relevant obstacles.  
      Determine the maximum net mass that would allow clearance of the highest relevant obstacles, given:

      Minimum off-route pressure altitude: 16000 ft  
      Temperature: ISA +10째C  
      A/C: AUTO (HIGH)  
      ANTI-ICE: ALL OFF
