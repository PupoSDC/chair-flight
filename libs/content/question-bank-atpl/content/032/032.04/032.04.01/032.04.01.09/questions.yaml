    question: Both runways are of equal length and have the same slope
      characteristics. Regardless of this, your EFB gives you a RTOM of 57ton
      for RWY 20L and 60ton for RWY 20R with the same take-off configuration.
      Which limitation is most likely causing the reduced RTOM for RWY 20L? Same
      meteorological conditions and friction level exists for both runways.

    question: >-
      Taking off from Lanzarote Airport with reported surface wind of 030/10\.
      There are two runways available for take-off, both with no slope.


      RWY 03: Facing the mountains with a TORA of 2 400 m. The aircraft will need to clear an obstacle 297 ft above threshold elevation which is 4 330 m away.  

      RWY 21: Facing the ocean with a TORA of 2 400 m. There are no obstacles in the climb path.  

      RWY 03 RTOM: 82 tonnes  

      RWY 21 RTOM: 84 tonnes


      Why is the RTOM for RWY 03 more limiting?
