    question:
      With regard to Obstacle-Limited Take-Off Mass, which of the following
      statements is correct?
    firstCorrectStatements:
      - Maximum Obstacle-Limited Take-Off Mass is the limiting take-off mass if
        the climb gradient to clear obstacle with required margins is lower than
        the minimum climb gradient.
    firstIncorrectStatements:
      - Maximum Obstacle-Limited Take-Off Mass is the limiting take-off mass if
        the climb gradient to clear obstacle with required margins is higher
        than the minimum climb gradient.
    secondCorrectStatements:
      - Obstacle limitations may not fully compensate the positive effects of
        headwinds.
    secondIncorrectStatements:
      - Obstacle limitations may overcompensate the positive effects of
        headwinds.

      A two engine turbojet has to initiate a turn in the second segment of the
      take-off flight path. During the turn there is an obstacle that requires a
      net climb gradient of 2.0% in order to clear the obstacle. The bank angle
      during the turn is 15° and the flight manual gives a decrement for the
      turn of 0.5%.

    question: After commencing the descent, the pilot of a jet aircraft is
      instructed by the ATC to keep the speed high and issues an altitude
      restriction up to FL120 at a waypoint 50 NM before the planned position.
      The pilot realizes that he/she will not be able to meet the restriction
      with the current rate of descent. What action(s) should he/she do?

      The annex above shows takeoff performance data from two separate calculations using a computerised performance tool. Due to some recent reports of windshear, which would require the use of full TOGA thrust as per their SOPs, the pilots prepare the performance data for both a TOGA take-off and a take-off at an assumed (FLEX) temperature of 43°C.


      The only difference between the data is the thrust setting, however, one result of the different calculations is that...

    question: A Medium-Range Jet Transport aeroplane is planned to depart from a
      sufficiently long runway and the correct V-speeds have been calculated.
      The pilot has not flown this variant of the aircraft before, and it has a
      longer fuselage than the variant they have flown before. As the tail
      clearance during rotation is reduced on this longer aircraft, the pilot
      performs their rotation at a slightly slower (but still acceptable) rate
      than they would normally. What will this change?

      Refer to figure.


      A flight crew of a performance class A aeroplane are preparing for departure. Only the Captain has run the performance figures using an application on their electronic flight bag (EFB), and has not crosschecked the results with the first officer, who is busy preparing the departure routing. That aircraft's take-off mass is 68 000 kg, so is under the MTOM with reduced thrust setting of 68 262 kg that the Captain has calculated. The V-speeds for departure can be seen on the annex above, which is a small extract from the EFB performance tool. The V**MCG** is 118 kt.


      When inputting the V-speeds into the FMS, the Captain enters 140 kt for V**1**. During take-off, the pilot monitoring calls V**1** at the FMS selected V**1** speed, at which point an engine failure occurs. The engine failure is detected and acted upon at an airspeed of 143 kt.


      What would be the most likely scenario in this event?
