    question: You are the pilot of a transport category aeroplane and have just
      started a precision approach. You can recognise that you are too high and
      too fast on the descent path. You are flying in a (clean) aircraft
      configuration, which means that the landing gear is up and the flaps are
      retracted. What should you do?
    options:
      - id: OYJXX9MAZ
        text: Increase your airspeed, which will result in an increase in your rate of
          descent, allowing you to get back on the descent path.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OA1FNP1WC
        text: Decrease your airspeed and rate of descent to get back on your descent
          path. When back on the descent path, plan for a flaps-up approach with
          a higher airspeed.
        correct: false

        text: Decrease your airspeed and rate of descent to get back on your descent
          path. When back on the descent path, reduce your airspeed and start
          extending flaps and landing gear on schedule.

        text: Decrease airspeed to below V**LO** and extend the landing gear, followed
          by flaps , to increase drag and get back on the descent path and speed
          profile.

    question: The pilots are analysing the aircraft's fuel consumption whilst in the
      cruise, noticing that the fuel consumption is higher than planned. ATC
      instructs the pilot to descend at high speed. Which of the following
      speeds is the best to descend at?
    options:
      - id: ONHSU9P7Q
        text: Minimum power required speed

    question: "An aeroplane receives a late descent clearance from ATC due to
      opposite traffic with all factors being equal and constant. Choose the
      correct statement. The pilot may:"

        text: Use speed brakes and maintain planned descent speed, however, the
          aeroplane will have a higher energy state when back on the planned
          profile.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OCSROMSCG
        text: Increase drag by increasing the airspeed and therefore increasing the
          descent angle, reducing the energy state of the aeroplane due to extra
          drag.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OHDA0PK2C
        text: Slow down and use speed brakes to increase the drag and increase the
          descent angle since the speed brakes are more effective at lower
          airspeed.
