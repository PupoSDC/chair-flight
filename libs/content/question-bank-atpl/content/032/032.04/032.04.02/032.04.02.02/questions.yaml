        text:
          Climb with a constant IAS/CAS has to be levelled off to achieve a given
          Mach number at this altitude.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OQT443S4N
        text:
          The cross over altitude is the only pressure altitude where a certain
          IAS/CAS matches the same Mach number in any atmospheric condition.
        correct: false
