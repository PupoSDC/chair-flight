    question: |-
      Here is an extract of an exchange of radio-communication between the pilot of F-GTPO and Lille Tower: "F-PO, squawk 6101." "6101, F-PO." "F-PO, radar identified, cleared to Lille via route SA then leave controlled airspace via route N." "Cleared to Lille via route SA then leave controlled airspace via route N, F-PO." After a short while, F-PO is entering controlled airspace. "F-PO, Lille Tower, radio check 118.550." No answer. "F-PO, Lille Tower, if you read me, squawk IDENT." No answer but the controller\`s radar shows that IDENT has been operated.

      Assume that specific procedures for communication failure procedures have NOT been established for Lille Tower.

      Which of the following statements are correct?

      1\. F-PO shall exit controlled airspace as soon as possible because he/she has a communication failure.   
      2\. F-PO is a controlled flight and must continue its transit to follow its clearance, unless this is incompatible with the regulation applicable for communication failure.   
      3\. F-PO will NOT receive any instruction from Lille Tower that will alter its transit clearance, other traffic will be instructed away from F-PO to maintain separation as applicable.   
      4\. F-PO may receive additional instructions from Lille Tower and the clearances can be acknowledged by operating the transponder.
