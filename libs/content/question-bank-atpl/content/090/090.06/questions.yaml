    question: |-
      During a student's early solo navigation mission to destination Freetown, they have a list of frequencies written down to assist with communications, including the FREETOWN TOWER frequency:

      TOWER: "126.305" ("2" looks like a "1")  
      GROUND: "135.7"  
      VOR: "116.350"

      However, the student encounters difficulty interpreting their handwriting. Unsure about the correct frequency, the student tunes to "116.305". Which of the following statements is correct?

      controlled aerodrome. He/she carefully prepared all radio COM and NAV
      frequencies on a piece of paper, but he/she CANNOT find the paper any
      more. Luckily, on the VFR map, he/she finds the following frequencies: FRT
      TWR 126.305 FRT GND 118.680 FREETOWN FRT 116.35\\. Which frequency must
      he/she select in order to use the radio navigation aid to FREETOWN?"

    question: You are on one of your first solo navigation missions to destination
      Freetown. In the cockpit the usual radio and navigation frequencies are
      listed on a small card. Being a little stressed by the situation (solo
      flight, radio communication etc), you look for the tower frequency and
      find FREETOWN FRT 112.25 MHz on the frequency card. You start changing to
      this frequency on the radio. Which of the following is true?
