      A FMS can correct its fuel computations for the following non-standard configurations:

      1 – landing gear down.   
       2 – speed brakes extended.   
       3 – one engine out.   
       4 – slats / flaps not fully retracted.

      The combination that regroups all of the correct statements is:

    question: |-
      For most FMS the fuel prediction function, which computes the remaining fuel along the flight plan, takes into account the following parameters:

      1 – the additional drag in case the landing gear can not be retracted   
      2 – the cruise flight level   
      3 – the additional drag in case the flaps are blocked and partly extended   
      4 – the current wind computed or the resulting ground speed
