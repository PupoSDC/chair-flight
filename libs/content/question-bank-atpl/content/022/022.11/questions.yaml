      The FMS enables to fly an optimum flight profile. For this, the FMC
      (Flight Management Computer) uses:


      1 – flight-crew entered flight plan data   

      2 – data from ADC   

      3 – aircraft position   

      4 – a memorised relief world data base   

      5 – data from the FMC navigation data base.
