      An aircraft with a dual FMS configuration is ready to descend, according to the profile of an instrument approach procedure. An amber message is generated on the Crew Alerting System (CAS) concerning the failure of No.1 (Flight Management Computer FMC1). Following the failure of FMC1, which of the following are correct?

      1\. Both FMS units operate in independent mode (degraded operation),   
       2\. FMS2 operates in single mode, while FMS1 has failed,   
       3\. FMS2 computations are unreliable due to faulty data sent from FMS1,   
       4\. The crew shall revert to other navigational sources, if required.

      An aircraft is equipped with a dual FMS configuration. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) enters flight plan data through his/her Multifunction Control and Display Unit (MCDU). Soon after, the crew realises that those data are NOT shown on the cross-side MCDU, and the PM reads an alerting message concerning the operational mode of the FMSs.

      The FMS operate in (1) \_\_\_\_\_ mode, there is a problem with data transferring over the (2) \_\_\_\_\_ bus, and each MCDU communicates only with the (3) \_\_\_\_\_ FMS.

      The role of the FMS is to:

      1 – aid the crew with navigation   
      2 – shut down the engine in case of a malfunction   
      3 – automatically avoid conflicting traffic when autopilot engaged   
      4 – reduce crew workload   
      5 – aid fuel efficiency

      The combination that regroups all of the correct statements is:
