    question: |-
      An aircraft, flying at 20°N latitude, executes a left turn from 045° Magnetic Heading (MH) to 315° (MH). The pilot reads the MH indication from a Direct Reading Magnetic Compass (DRMC). Before commencing the turn, what should the pilot take into consideration?

      1\. He/she should roll out when the DRMC reads 335°, to read 315° MH with the wings level.   
       2\. He/she should roll out when the DRMC reads 295°, to read 315° MH with the wings level.   
       3\. The turning error of the DRMC increases as the bank angle increases.   
       4\. A timed turn would be more practical to execute; it would take 30 seconds with a rate-1 turn.   
       5\. A timed turn would be more practical to execute; it would take 90 seconds with a rate-1 turn.
