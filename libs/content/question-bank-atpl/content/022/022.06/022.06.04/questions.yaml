          Because all modes are in a small font when first selected. After 5 seconds

          large white font.

      On a Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA), the pilot can check:

      1 – the flight director modes.   
       2 – the flaps/slats position.   
       3 – the auto-throttle modes.

      The combination that regroups all of the correct statements is:
