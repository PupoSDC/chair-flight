    question: >-
      Refer to figure.


      The attached figure shows a Multifunction Display (MFD) with AFCS controls and Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). The pilot is performing a commercial air transport VFR flight and the passengers asked to deviate from the planned route. The pilot disengages the autopilot, turns off course and descends to a lower altitude. The Flight Director (FD) at this point indicates that the aircraft is NOT following the planned route. Should the pilot take further action?
    options:
      - id: OIBYHKMUZ
        text: No, the FD will remain ON and automatically change modes to show
          appropriate guidance for manual flight during the entire time the
          autopilot remains disengaged.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OTXYVUUKR
        text:
          No, the FMAs will automatically be removed from view and the FD command

      - id: OCR6Y9SCL
        text:
          Yes, the FD must either be switched OFF or the pilot must select modes and
          parameters for the new intended flight path for the FD to give
          appropriate guidance.

        why: ""
      - id: OI8FNO4RP
        text:
          Yes, the autopilot is still engaged and must be disengaged, because the FD
