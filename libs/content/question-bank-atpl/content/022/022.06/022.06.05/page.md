Try not to associate the number of autopilots with Fail Operational vs Fail
Passive redundancy.

A Fail Operational autoland system can have two monitored autopilots or 3
autopilots depending on the aircraft type. Only Fail Operational systems have an
alert height. A single failure in a Fail Operational system allows an autoland
to be completed.

Airbus aircraft with fail operational systems have 2 monitored autopilots, if
one autopilot fails the remaining one is being monitored so it's safe to carry
out an autoland.

Monitored means another system is checking that the autopilot is operating
correctly.

In the same way that the flying pilot is monitored by the non flying pilot on
the approach in case they try to kill you.

On a fly by wire aircraft like the Airbus there are several flight control
computers that can monitor the autopilots, hence there's no need for a 3rd
autopilot to give fail operational redundancy. Inertial information can be used
to monitor an autopilot, some 737NG's have fail operational systems despite only
having 2 autopilots. They use the standby instruments Attitude Heading Reference
System and an electrical autopilot rudder servo to make them CatIIIB capable.
Most 737's are Fail Passive though because Fail Operational is an expensive
option.
