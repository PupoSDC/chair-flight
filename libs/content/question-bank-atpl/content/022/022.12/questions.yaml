    question: A modern transport jet is flying at its cruising altitude of 37000
      feet in normal cruise flight. Suddenly and without warning, the pilots
      realize that the autothrottle system moved the thrust levers to idle,
      accompanied with the FMA 'RETARD' message. In order to control the
      situation, the pilot flying increases the thrust back to its initial
      position and takes over manual control of the thrust levers. What could be
      the probable cause of this issue?
