    question: >-
      An altitude alert system must at least warn the crew:


      1 – when approaching the pre-selected altitude   

      2 – when the aeroplane is approaching the ground too fast   

      3 – in case of a given deviation above or below the pre-selected altitude   

      4 – in case of excessive vertical speed   

      5 – when approaching the ground with the gear retracted

    question: |-
      The function of the altitude alerting system is to alert the flight crew:

      1 – upon approaching a pre-selected altitude   
      2 – upon approaching a pre-selected altitude, during climb only   
      3 – of a loss of altitude during take-off or missed approach   
      4 – of a wrong landing configuration   
      5 – when deviating from the selected altitude
