      The alternate static source of a light non-pressurised aircraft is located
      in the flight deck and when used usually:


      1 – the airspeed indicator tends to under-read   

      2 – the airspeed indicator tends to over-read   

      3 – the altimeter tends to under-read   

      4 – the altimeter tends to over-read

      The angle of attack transmitter placed laterally on the forward part of
      the fuselage supplies an electrical signal which can indicate the angular
      position of:


      1 – a specific slaved pitot probe   

      2 – a vane detector   

      3 – a conical slotted probe.
