      An aeroplane is cruising at FL 60 with a TAS of 100 kt in standard
      atmosphere. In these conditions:


      1 – the TAS is approximately 10% higher than the IAS.   

      2 – the difference between the EAS and the CAS is negligible.   

      3 – the speed displayed on the airspeed indicator is a CAS if the position error and instrument error are zero.

    question: Consider a standard atmosphere and NO performance degradation due to
      increased altitude. During climb through FL260 with a constant CAS of 300
      kt the indicated rate of climb is 2 000 feet per minute, and the Mach
      number is 0.76\. You decide to continue the climb and maintain a constant
      speed of M 0.76\. What will happen to the Rate of Climb and TAS?
