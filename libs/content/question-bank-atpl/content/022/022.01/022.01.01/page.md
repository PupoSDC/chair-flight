  <Text variant="oneCorrect">Parallax error is:</Text>
  <Option>due to temperature effect</Option>
  <Option correct>a reading error</Option>
  <Option>due to the effect of aircraft accelerations</Option>
  <Option>due to pressure effect</Option>

  <Explanation>
    Parallax error, is an error that can occur by looking at a mechanical
    instrument that is not directly in front of you. There is a gap between the
    needle and the display marks, meaning that if you read the instrument at an
    angle it will appear as if the needle is indicating a different value from
    the correct one.

  <Option why="This answer is not necessarily wrong, but it's a bit inconsequential: It describe all electrical pressure measurement systems. This question is trying to see if you know what type of sensor is used for what instruments.">
    By Electrical signals generated by a pressure sensing element in a remote
    location.
