          would be very difficult to apply safely and consistently to a mechanical

    question: >-
      If the speed exceeds VMO/MMO and according to the type of aeroplane, the
      overspeed protection function can:


      1 – reduce thrust to idle.   
       2 – send a pitch up order.   
       3 – inhibit the pitch trim orders in the nose up direction.
