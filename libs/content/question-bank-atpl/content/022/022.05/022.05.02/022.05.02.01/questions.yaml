      The positions of the mode selector of an inertial navigation unit are: OFF
      – STBY – ALIGN – NAV – ATT:


      1 – in "STBY", the unit aligns on the local geographic co-ordinate system

      A pilot checks the position error of a stand-alone INS against a known
      position fix, having completed one hour of flying. The error is
      approximately 2 NM. This error varies and depends on:


      1\. Gyro drift rate.   
       2\. Wind drift.   
       3\. Accelerometer bias.   
       4\. Initial misalignment   
       5\. Computational errors.   
       6\. Pilot handling skills.
