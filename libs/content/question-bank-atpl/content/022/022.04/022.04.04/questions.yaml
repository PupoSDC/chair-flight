      The indications of the directional gyro as an on-board instrument are
      valid only for a short period of time. What are the causes of this
      inaccuracy?


      1\. the Earth's rotation.   
       2\. the longitudinal acceleration.   
       3\. the aircraft's motion over the surface of the Earth.   
       4\. the mechanical defects of the gyro.   
       5\. the gyro's weight.   
       6\. the gimbal mount of the gyro rings.
