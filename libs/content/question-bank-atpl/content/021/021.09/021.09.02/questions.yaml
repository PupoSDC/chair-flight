    question: >-
      Regarding the capacity of a battery and its measurement, which
      statement(s) is/are correct/incorrect?


      1.The battery capacity is determined by multiplying a current flow in Amperes by the time in hours that the battery is being discharged.   
       2.The total battery capacity is dependent on the voltage rating of its battery cells.
