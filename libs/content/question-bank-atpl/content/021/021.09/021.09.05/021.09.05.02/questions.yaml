      Which of the following statements is correct?   
        
       1\. By increasing the load on an electric motor (i.e. increasing the resistance against rotation), the power output will increase as a result of an increased current flow.   
       2\. The torque of an electrical motor can be calculated by dividing the power by the motor RPM.

      Which of the following statements is correct or incorrect related to an
      electric motor?


      1\. Mechanical torque (T) is directly proportional to the voltage (E) x current (I) and is inversely proportional to the strength of the generated magnetic field.   
       2\. Mechanical torque (T) is directly proportional to the voltage (E) divided by the current (I) and is directly proportional to the strength of the generated magnetic field.
