      Static dischargers:


      1\. are used to set all the parts of the airframe to the same electrical potential.   

      2\. are placed on wing and tail tips to facilitate electrical discharge.   

      3\. are used to reset the electrostatic potential of the aircraft to a value approximating 0 volts.   

      4\. are located on wing and tail tips to reduce interference with the on-board radio communication systems to a minimum.   

      5\. limit the risks of transfer of electrical charges between the aircraft and the electrified clouds.

      The purpose of bonding the metallic parts of an aircraft is to:


      1\. prevent electrolytic corrosion between mating surfaces of similar metals.   

      2\. ensure zero voltage difference between aircraft components.   

      3\. isolate all components electrically.   

      4\. provide a single earth for electrical devices.
