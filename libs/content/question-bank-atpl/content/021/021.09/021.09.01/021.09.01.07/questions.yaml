      Which one of the following statements is true when checking and using
      fuses and circuit breakers?   
        
       (1) Circuit breakers should always be reset.   
       (2) Circuit breakers should never be reset.   
       (3) Circuit breakers should not be reset too often.   
       (4) After a fuse has tripped, it is better to replace it with a fuse of a higher rating.   
       (5) After a fuse has tripped, it is better to replace it with a fuse of a lower rating.   
       (6) After a fuse has tripped, it is better to replace it with a fuse of the same rating.
