      Generally, when the fire handle of the engine fire-extinguishing system on
      an aeroplane is pulled, the effects are:


      1\. opening of the bleed air valves and HP valves on the engine concerned.   

      2\. arming of the extinguishing system.   

      3\. immediate discharge of extinguishing agent.   

      4\. deactivation of the electric generators.
