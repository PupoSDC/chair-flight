      Flutter occurs when an external force is applied to the aircraft with a
      periodic frequency that is (1) \_\_ the natural structural frequency of
      that aircraft.


      Flutter can be avoided by ensuring that the aircraft remains inside the certified flight envelope, particularly for (2)\_\_ and during turbulent conditions.

      Control surface flutter can be avoided by:


      1\. a high stiffness of the structure to which the control surface is attached.   

      2\. a low stiffness of the structure to which the control surface is attached.   

      3\. locating a balancing mass in front of the control surface hinge line.   

      4\. locating a balancing mass behind the control surface hinge line.
