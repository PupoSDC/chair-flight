      The following are required to start a turbine engine:

      1\. The compressor must be rotated to get air into the combustion chamber.   
       2\. The compressor must be rotated to cool the turbine blades.   
       3\. Fuel must be provided in the combustion chamber(s).   
       4\. Ignition must be provided to start the fuel/air mixture burning.   
       5\. The turbine blades must be rotated to extract the exhaust gases from the combustion chamber.   
       6\. The turbine blades must be rotated by an APU to drive the accessories.
