    question: >-
      The characteristics of an axial compressor in a gas turbine engine
      compared to a centrifugal compressor with the same engine diameter are:


      1– a low pressure ratio by stage.   

      2 –a high pressure ratio by stage.   

      3 – the possibility of compressing a large mass airflow.   

      4 – the inability of compressing a large mass airflow.


      The combination that regroups all of the correct statements is :
