      Which of these statements is correct/incorrect regarding fly by wire
      flight controls?


      1\. When two inputs in a fly by wire system are detected they are not mixed together. The commander's inputs are given the priority electronically.   
       2\. When two inputs are detected they are mixed together and if the combined inputs are a full deflection, the result will be not more than a full single stick deflection
