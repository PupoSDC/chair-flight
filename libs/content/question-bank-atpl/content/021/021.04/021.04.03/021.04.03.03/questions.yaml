    question: Which of the following statements about an anti-skid system are
      correct/incorrect?
    firstCorrectStatements:
      - The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed
        to provide a slip ratio for maximum braking performance.
    firstIncorrectStatements:
      - The anti-skid computer compares wheel speed to aeroplane reference speed
        to provide a slip ratio for minimum braking performance.
    secondCorrectStatements:
      - If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will still not be
        able to achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with
        anti-skid.
    secondIncorrectStatements:
      - If a pilot is careful when braking manually, he/she will be able to
        achieve the same braking efficiency as if braking with anti-skid.
