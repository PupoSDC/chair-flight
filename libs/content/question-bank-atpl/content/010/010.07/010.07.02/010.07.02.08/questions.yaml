    question:
      "A pilot is on the approach into an aerodrome in an aircraft in the
      MEDIUM wake turbulence category and have been told to expect an ILS
      approach to runway 27\\. The aircraft directly ahead of him/her, at the
      same altitude and landing at the same aerodrome, has received the
      following transmission from ATS: ‘FASTAIR 47 HEAVY, EXPECT ILS APPROACH
      FOR RUNWAY 27’. In this scenario, what distance-based wake turbulence
      separation shall be applied by ATS between his/her aircraft and the
      aircraft ahead of him/her?"
