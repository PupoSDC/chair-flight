    question: An aircraft is on final approach to land on RWY 04 in Stansted. In
      order to maintain the desired traffic spacing, the controller instructs
      the crew to reduce the horizontal speed. When the controller requests the
      speed control, the aircraft should be at a distance greater than (1)
      \_\_\_\_\_ from the threshold. Furthermore, speed adjustments should NOT
      exceed plus/minus (2) \_\_\_\_\_ IAS (Indicated Airspeed).
