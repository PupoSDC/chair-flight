      1\. At the start of the initial approach segment, the ATC verifies that the entire approach can be conducted in visual meteorological conditions.  

      2\. The pilot can maintain visual reference to the terrain.  

      3\. The pilot reports at the level of the beginning of the initial approach segment or any time during the instrument approach that the meteorological conditions are such that a visual approach and landing can be completed.
