      A pilot is performing visual patterns at a controlled aerodrome when
      he/she notices that the radio is unserviceable. The aircraft forms part of
      the aerodrome traffic. Which option correctly lists all the actions (given
      below) that the pilot must take?


      1\. If a series of red flashes is observed, divert as the aerodrome is unsafe.   

      2\. Attempt to establish contact with the appropriate ATS unit using all other available means.   

      3\. If a series of green flashes is observed, approach to land at the aerodrome.
