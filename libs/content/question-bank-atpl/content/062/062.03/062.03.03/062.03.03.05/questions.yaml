    question: Why should the tilt of an Airborne Weather Radar system (without auto
      tilt) be changed to a higher setting when descending over terrain?
    options:
      - id: OHOXOMQZY
        text: The higher tilt setting will narrow the beam width, allowing for effective
          detection of cumulonimbus clouds at shorter range.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OP00TOCEY
        text: If the beam’s tilt remains at the setting used during cruise, the scanning
          range will be reduced and significant ground clutter may be displayed.
        correct: true
        why: ""

        text: If the beam’s tilt remains at the setting used during cruise, the scanning
          range will be reduced and the strength of the reflected signals will
          be weaker.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OKLCBCJRT
        text: "The higher tilt setting will keep the beam above the aircraft’s flight
          path.  "
        correct: false

    question: The tilt of an Airborne Weather Radar is lowered whilst searching for
      thunderstorms in high-level cruise flight. Why is that?
    options:
      - id: OURGTSCAI
        text: The greatest reflectivity occurs from wet hail and rain, these elements
          usually exist in the lower levels of a thunderstorm.
        correct: true
        why: ""
      - id: OWQAASVBS
        text: Ground clutter is more evident and therefore less likely to be confused
          with thunderstorm activity.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OY7LLYZA9
        text: Ground clutter enhances the display by automatically turning up the gain
          and increasing the likelihood of detecting thunderstorm activity.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OF6EFQVED
        text: The greatest reflectivity occurs from dry hail and snow, these elements
          exist mainly in the lower levels of a thunderstorm.
        correct: false
