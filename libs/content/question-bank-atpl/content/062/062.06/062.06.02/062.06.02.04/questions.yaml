    question:
      A flight is planned to Longyear Airport in Svalbard (lat. 78Â°15'N),
      Due to the high latitude the aircraft GPS will NOT be able to achieve RAIM
      during the arrival phase of flight, as not enough satellites will be in
      view. If the aircraft is suitably equipped, which of the following systems
      could be used for integrity monitoring?
