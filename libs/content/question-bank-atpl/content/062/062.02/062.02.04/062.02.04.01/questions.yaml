    question: |-
      Which of the following statements correctly describe the principles of operation of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)?

      1\. The aircraft's primary radar output transmits a signal that triggers a reply from the DME station.   
       2\. A transmission from the aircraft's interrogator triggers a reply from the DME station.   
       3\. The time taken from interrogation transmission to the reply reception is used to determine slant range.   
       4\. The time taken from interrogation transmission to the reply reception is used to determine plan range.
