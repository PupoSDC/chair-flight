    question: A DME ground station can generally respond to a maximum of 100
      aircraft at once. What is the reason for this limitation?
    options:

        text: Limitation of transmission by the echo protection circuit, which avoids
          replies being reflected and coming back into the DME ground station.

        text: The difference in strengths of the received signals CANNOT be
          differentiated by the DME ground station, and consequently the weakest

    question: A particular DME ground station is very busy and can sometimes be used
      by more than 100 aircraft at a time. When during one of these extremely
      busy periods, the DME ground station may not respond to some aircraft
      based on...

    question: Which statement about the interrogation by the DME-interrogator is correct?
    options:
      - id: OYJMK4XVO
        text: The interrogation starts when the interrogator has been warmed up
          sufficiently, whether pulse-pairs are received or not.
