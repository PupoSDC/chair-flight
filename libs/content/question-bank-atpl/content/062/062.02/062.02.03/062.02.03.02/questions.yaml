    question: >-
      A pilot is tracking inbound to a VOR on a designated radial using the HSI.
      The VOR ground station is located in an area with varying terrain and
      man-made obstructions. The pilot notices that the CDI is fluctuating
      slightly, even though he/she is constantly and accurately tracking inbound
      to the station and there is no apparent wind effect.


      What is the term used to describe these fluctuations?
