    question: You are flying across northern Canada on airway NCA Whiskey. You wish
      to cross check the IRS computed position by taking a bearing from a nearby
      VOR. You tune into the Churchill VOR and find you are on the 190° radial.
      What is the bearing to plot on a chart if the variation at the VOR is 2°W
      and the variation at the aircraft is 4°E.
