    question: An aircraft is being radar vectored for an ILS approach and is
      receiving the ILS ident correctly. When on the downwind leg, the pilots
      observe the ILS indications changing randomly and both the localiser and
      glide path showing warning flags intermittently. What is the most likely
      reason for this?
