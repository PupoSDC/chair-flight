    question: Which statement about VHF/UHF propagation in connection with Ground
      Direction Finders is correct?
    options:
      - id: OBFVW0WFV
        text: For both VHF/UHF propagation, the space wave is the only propagation path
          of practical use. There is no sky wave under normal conditions.
        correct: true
        why: ""
      - id: OYPE5BCQY
        text: Neither VHF/UHF has a sky wave under any conditions. For VHF the surface
          wave is the main propagation path and for UHF the space wave.
        correct: false
        why: ""

        text: VHF-frequencies below 120 MHz may be subjected to sporadic E-reflection
          and then have a sky wave. For both VHF/UHF the surface wave is the
          only propagation path of practical use.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OBKM3IQXW
        text: VHF has, under normal conditions, a sky wave, whereas UHF has not. For
          both VHF/UHF propagation the space wave is the main propagation path.
        correct: false
        why: ""
