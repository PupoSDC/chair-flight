    question: |-
      A flight crew is in the cruise, preparing to fly an RNP APCH. Which of the following should they do?

      1\. Load the procedure from a valid aircraft navigation database.   
       2\. Individually insert each waypoint's coordinates into the navigation system.   
       3\. Cross-check the waypoint sequence with a valid approach chart.   
       4\. Cross-check the lateral path with a VOR or NDB overlay approach.

    question: You are flying in IMC at night above the 73°North latitude. Because of
      the high latitude and the GNSS satellite positions, you elect to fly an
      RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima based on barometric VNAV with GNSS horizontal
      guidance. The minimum published temperature for the approach is -8°C, and
      your aircraft does not have automatic temperature-compensation fitted. The
      temperature given by the most recent ATIS is -6°C. During final approach,
      ATC tells you to make an immediate go around because terrain separation is
      no longer guaranteed. What is the most likely reason for losing minimum
      terrain separation?
