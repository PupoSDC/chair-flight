      You are approaching airfield MÜHLDORF (EDMY, N48° 16.77' E012° 30.02') from the east on track 270°. The descent should be planned to arrive at an altitude of 3 500 ft approximately abeam of airfield ALTÖTTING.


      Atmospheric conditions = ISA,   

      TAS = 110 kt,   

      average wind = 300°(T) / 16 kt,   

      rate of descent = 500 ft/min,   

      cruising level = FL125.


      How many nautical miles from MÜHLDORF is your top of descent (ToD)?
