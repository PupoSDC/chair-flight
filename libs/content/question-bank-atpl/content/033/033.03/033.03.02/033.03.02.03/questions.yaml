      The annex shows a typical fuel plan with operational impact factors as produced by a flight planning tool. When arriving at the plane the Commander is informed that some additional cargo has been loaded. This extra weight means that the aeroplane is NOT to reach its planned cruising level.

      The flight crew of a turbojet aeroplane prepares a flight using the following data:


      Flight leg distance: 3 500 NM   

      Flight level FL 310   

      True airspeed: 450 kt   

      Headwind component at this level: 55 kt   

      Initially planned take-off mass (without extra fuel on board): 180 000 kg   

      Fuel price: 0.30 Euro/l at departure 0.27 Euro/l at destination


      To maximize savings, the commander decides to carry extra fuel in addition to that which is necessary.Using the appended annex, the optimum quantity of fuel which should be carried in addition to the prescribed quantity is:
