    question: Explain the basic idea of the predetermined point procedure (PDP).
    options:
      - id: ODHZT6YUG
        text: The predetermined point procedure (PDP) requires the operator to
          predetermine a point at which a flight must divert to the alternate
          aerodrome when it is calculated in a fuel check that it has used some
          of its contingency fuel. It therefore increases flight safety by
          increase of the fuel that is still on board overhead the planned
          destination.

          The predetermined point procedure (PDP) provides an option to select
          an aerodrome as destination alternate which is at a distance from the


          planned destination that it cannot be reached after first flying to the destination. It therefore increases maximum range by reduction of mandatory fuel reserves.

        text:
          The predetermined point procedure (PDP) permits planning of a flight to a
          destination where no alternate is available. When the aircraft reaches
          the predetermined point, the probability to land at the destination
          must be almost certain, or the aircraft has to return to its
          departure.

        text:
          The predetermined point procedure (PDP) is a procedure where the flight is
          not planned to the intended destination but to a closer aerodrome, and
          fuel, including contingency fuel, is computed to this aerodrome. The
          additional fuel to the real destination is taken as “extra”.At the
          predetermined point, the flight is “replanned” to the intended
          destination. It therefore increases payload by reduction of required
          contingency fuel.
