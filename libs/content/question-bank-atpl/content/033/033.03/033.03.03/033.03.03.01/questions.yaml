      Given the following data for the pre-flight calculations, determine the
      Contingency Fuel for a Commercial Air Transport flight from Paris to
      Barcelona. Assume the Basic Fuel Scheme WITHOUT variations applies.


      Trip Fuel: 4 560 kg  

      Fuel flow at 1500 feet above destination aerodrome: 2304 kg/h  

      Fuel penalty when flying 2000 feet lower than optimum altitude: 232 kg  

      Extra Fuel: 0 kg  

      Discretionary Fuel: 0 kg

      A pilot is planning a flight from aerodrome M to aerodrome N and, so as to
      increase the traffic load, uses the Reduced Contingency Fuel procedure for
      his/her fuel calculations, selecting a decision point (DP) and an
      aerodrome R as optional refuel station. Given the information below,
      calculate the minimum fuel required from aerodrome M to N.


      Taxi Fuel at aerodrome M: 180 kg   
       Final Reserve Fuel: 1 300 kg   
       Trip fuel from M to N via DP: 8 500 kg   
       Trip fuel from M to R: 7 800 kg   
       Trip Fuel from DP to N : 3 500 kg   
       Do NOT take into account Alternate and Extra Fuel.   
       An ERA for the optional refuel station is NOT available.
