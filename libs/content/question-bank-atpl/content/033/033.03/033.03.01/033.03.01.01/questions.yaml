    question: The flight crew has 1 hour flight time remaining of a 4 hours flight
      towards the destination aerodrome. The FMS displays the message DEST EFOB
      BELOW MIN and the Commander looks at the FMS data to see that there is an
      estimated 0.3 tonnes less fuel than required when arriving at the
      destination. Under NORMAL circumstances for a commercial Air transport
      flight with one destination alternate nominated, what is the minimum fuel
      to be expected on board when arriving at the destination aerodrome?
