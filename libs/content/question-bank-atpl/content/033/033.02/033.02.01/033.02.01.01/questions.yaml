    question: An aircraft is following a defined RNP 2 route and approaching a
      waypoint where a track change of 40º is required. The route is part of a
      route system with 4 parallel routes and reliable lateral separation
      between the aircraft on the different routes is essential. Which of the
      following types of FMS coding of the waypoint will ensure lateral
      separation between aircraft also during the turn?
