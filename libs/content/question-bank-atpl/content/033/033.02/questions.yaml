      A pilot is under radar vectors in order to position for an ILS approach to runway 07\. ATC clears the aircraft to descend to 4 000 ft on a heading of 105º to establish on and follow the ILS. Suddenly a complete electrical failure occurs and all navigation instruments are lost except for the standby compass. If the aircraft is in cloud, what is a safe altitude for the pilot to maintain while trying to restore the navigation instruments?
