    question: |-
      The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of an aircraft is inoperative. There are no ground-start facilities available at the aerodrome, but the APU is necessary to start the engines. Therefore, one engine is kept running while the aircraft is refueled, and ground serviced. The temperature is around 0ºC and a light snow is falling. De-icing treatment is permitted only with engines off. If all the engines are shut down, the aircraft can only be re-started once the APU is repaired.   
       To depart from the airport as planned, the Commander decides not to de-ice. A few minutes after take-off, the aircraft develops ice-formation on the wings and consequently, it stalls.   
        
       Which of the following statements most correctly explains the decision-making of the Commander?

    question: |-
      An aircraft operating with the FMS in the LNAV VNAV mode is operating in a busy terminal area at the end of a flight. Bad weather in the area has resulted in ATC requiring the flight crew to make several changes to the aircraft's flight path.   
        
       In order to maintain the maximum awareness of their flight status, what is the best action for the pilots to take?
    options:
      - id: OIWNPJWNO
        text: Re-programming of the FMS in the LNAV VNAV mode during periods of high
          workload can lead to errors and also cause a loss of situational
          awareness. Therefore, the pilots should downgrade to a lower, simpler
          level of automation such as ALT/HDG or even to manual flying.

          entry of the new LNAV/VNAV parameters at the same time.
