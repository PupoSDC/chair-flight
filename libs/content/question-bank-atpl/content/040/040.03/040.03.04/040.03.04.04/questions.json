On this day, the visibility was greatly reduced due to fog. \nThe KLM 747 received a flight clearance. The First Officer finishes his reedback by saying \"We are now ready for take-off\". The controller replies \"OK, stand-by for take-off\". However, the crew of the KLM 747 only heard the part 'OK' because the rest of the sentence was cut off due to a transmission from another aircraft on the frequency (an interruption). The captain of the KLM 747 interpreted the 'OK' as a clearance for take-off and started the take-off roll.  But at the same time, the 747 of Pan Am was taxiing on the runway, leading to the fatal crash. \nWhat type of communication and associated disadvantage of are illustrated by the incident described above ?",
