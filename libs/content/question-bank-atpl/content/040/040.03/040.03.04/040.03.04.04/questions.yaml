    question: |-
      On March 27th 1977, at Tenerife Aifield, a Pan American and KLM aircraft were involved in a crash leading to multiple fatalities. On the day the visibility was severly restricted due to fog. The KLM aircraft received a flight clearance and the First Officer completed his readback with "we are now ready for take-off". The controller replied "OK, stand by for take-off". At this time there was a transmission from another aircraft on the frequency which interupted this message from the controller, the result being that the KLM crew only heard "OK". The KLM Captain interpreted "OK" as take-off clearance and started the take-off roll. The Pan Am aircraft was still taxing on the runway and the two collided.
