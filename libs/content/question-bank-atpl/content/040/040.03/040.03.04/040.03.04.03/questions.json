The 55 year old Co-Pilot, who used to be a senior commander, recently joined the Operator, and has logged 11 200 total flight hours (also with 1 500 on type).

The Ground Proximity Warning System then sounds, \"too low terrain\". The Co-Pilot says: \"We're going to make it\", and continues the approach, instead of starting the mandatory go-around procedure. The commander does NOT challenge the decision of the Co-Pilot and does NOT take control of the aircraft.

      "question": "In January 1989, a Boeing 737-400, which had just recently been delivered to the airline, was operated by two pilots who had only been flying the previous version before. The aircraft suffered a structural failure of a turbine blade of its No. 1 engine, causing vibrations, followed by a smell of smoke in the cockpit. Due to their experience with the previous version of the aircraft, the crew figured that the malfunctioning engine had to be No.2, as this had been the engine supplying cabin bleed air on their previous type. Consequently, No. 2 engine was shut down and thrust on No. 1 was increased. As this action stopped the vibrations, both pilots were convinced that they had acted correctly and planned their diversion to East Midlands Airport.   \n Meanwhile, the damage to engine No.1 in combination with the high demands placed upon it caused a fire, which was noticed by the cabin crew and several passengers. The pilots, however, failed to detect the corresponding indications. On final approach, the thrust produced by engine No. 1 suddenly decreased to a level which was insufficient to carry the aircraft, which was fully configured for landing, over the bank of a road less than 900 metres in front of the runway.\n\nSelect the threat to aeronautical decision making which did NOT play a role in the accident:",
