    question: An aircraft is flying at an altitude of 2 000 feet, the aircraft must
      intercept the glide slope from above for an automatic ILS approach. The
      SPEED autothrottle mode is selected on the Mode Control Panel. Just before
      the descent the left (number 1) radio altimeter reading drops to -8 ft,
      which automatically causes the autothrottle to close (RETARD). The right
      (number 2) radio altimeter reads 2000 ft. The pilots see the change in the
      autothrottle setting but, as the number 2 radio altimeter is still
      operating, they assume that it still controls the autothrottle and that
      the RETARD mode is normal for the descent. They do NOT adjust the settings
      on the Mode Control Panel. On intercepting the glide slope, the pilots
      assume the autothrottle will automatically enter the SPEED mode, and do
      NOT detect that the throttles actually remain closed until the loss of
      airspeed becomes critical. What does this scenario indicate about the

    question: During a flight, a "land immediately" situation arises and the pilots
      make the decision to ditch. The Commander, possessing experience and
      confidence, has limited familiarity and training in water operations

      the Commander commits a procedural error, the Co-Pilot, using a

      an instrument approach. The flight is on schedule, and the landing will be
      made according to the flight plan. When the pilot started the approach,
      the vertical visibility reduced to below the minima. He/she decides to
      continue the approach and the aircraft lands safely. Which statement is
      correct for this scenario?

    question: |-
      The pilot of a small single-pilot business jet counts over 10 000 hours on type. He/she has spent the day flying his/her passengers on a shopping round trip through European cities. On the way home, at around 8 pm, the passengers start feeling anxious to finally get home. Before departure, the weather conditions at the destination were reported to be fairly good, however the latest ATIS gives visibility and cloud base just above the aircraft’s minima. During the initial approach, he/she is informed of a further deterioration of weather conditions, which will presumably not permit him/her to see the runway at minimum height. Still, he/she decides to continue the approach nonetheless and lands safely at his/her home base.

They receive an ATIS announcing CB with associated severe turbulence and windshear. The captain summarises: “We are almost at our crosswind limit; if you can see the runway, then we can make it.” The copilot knows that the captain is highly experienced in poor-weather flying. He perceives flashing lights, he/she believes that they could be the runway and, despite an initial uneasy feeling in his stomach, decides to make an approach to land.

      During a long cruise with the auto-flight system engaged, a pilot becomes bored and realises that they may be suffering from hypovigilance. What can they do to overcome this?

      1\. Maintain good crew communication.   
       2\. Keep vigilant during the cruise and strictly adhere to SOPs.   
       3\. Fly the aircraft manually if conditions permit.   
       4\. Experiment with the auto-flight system during the cruise to learn and fully understand its operating principles.

    question: During their approach, the crew of a Lockheed Tristar noticed that a
      green light indicating a locked nose gear had failed to illuminate and
      requested permission to enter a holding pattern for troubleshooting. They
      were assigned a position over an uninhabited swamp area, which was
      completely dark that night. While all the crew members were occupied with
      the landing gear indicator, one of the pilots inadvertently knocked a
      control wheel, bringing the aircraft into a gradual descent, which went
      unnoticed. The air traffic controller discovered that the aircraft had
      descended to 900 ft and asked if there was any trouble, but did not
      mention the altitude loss directly. The crew confirmed that everything was
      alright. Only seconds before the crash, the first officer realised that
      they were descending into the swampland, but the crash could no longer be
      prevented at the stage. Select the statement which is NOT true with regard
