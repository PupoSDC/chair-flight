      On 8th July 2010, the crew of a Boeing 737 from Nice to Frankfurt was
      cleared by the controller of Sector L14 to continue its climb to FL320\.
      In an adjacent sector, the crew of an Airbus 319 from London to Milan were
      cleared to leave FL 390 and to descend to FL 330\. The instruction was
      read back correctly, but the pilots incorrectly entered FL 320 into the
      FMS. Upon being handed off to sector L14, the Airbus called the
      controller:   
       "Easy 529 Yankee, descending FL320 on radar heading 150"   
       The controller identified the traffic, however he/she did not realise the incorrect flight level reported by the Airbus.   
       Shortly after, the two aircraft were converging on FL 320 and triggered potential conflict alerts on both the controller's system and the on-board TCAS of each aircraft. Corrective action had to be taken by each aircraft to re-establish separation.

    question:
      An aeroplane is flying at 2 500 ft. The SPEED mode is active on the
      autothrottle. The first radio altimeter starts to display a non-correct
      value (-8 ft). This behaviour of the radio altimeter will automatically
      cancel the SPEED mode of the auto-throttle. The pilots noticed the
      malfunction of the first radio altimeter but didn't notice the
      deactivation of the SPEED mode and, as the second radio altimeter was
      acting well, they continued on, using the second rad-alt. When
      intercepting the ILS Glide Slope, both crew believe that the autothrottle
      is still in SPEED mode and therefore, they do not understand why the speed
      is not being actively managed by the aircraft. Which of the following
