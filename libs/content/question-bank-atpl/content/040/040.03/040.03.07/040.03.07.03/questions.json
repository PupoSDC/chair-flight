The instruction was read back correctly, but the pilots incorrectly entered FL 320 into the FMS. Upon being handed off to sector L14, the Airbus called the controller:\n\"Easy 529 Yankee, descending FL 320 on radar heading 133\"\nThe controller identified the traffic but did NOT realise the incorrect flight level reported by the Airbus.\nShortly after, the two aircraft were converging on FL 320 and triggered potential conflict alerts on both the controller's system and the on-board TCAS of each aircraft. Corrective action had to be taken by each aircraft to re-establish separation.\nWhat type of communication and associated disadvantage are illustrated by this serious incident of a \"level bust\" with resulting loss of separation?",
