The 55-year-old Co-Pilot, who used to be a senior Commander, recently joined the Operator, and has logged 11200 flight hours (1500 on type). The Co-Pilot is Pilot Flying on approach. Below the Minimum Descent Altitude the crew still do NOT have the runway in sight. Then the Ground Proximity Warning System sounds (\"too low terrain\"). The Co-Pilot says: \"We're going to make it\", and continues the approach, instead of starting the go-around as required by the procedures. The Commander does NOT challenge the decision of the Co-Pilot and does NOT take control of the aircraft. The approach is continued. The result is a Controlled Flight Into Terrain.
