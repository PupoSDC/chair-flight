    question: >-
      During a two-hour domestic flight, the Commander keeps testing the
      knowledge of the Co-Pilot, arrogantly lecturing and advising him/her for 1
      hour after take-off. Thereafter, the Co-Pilot remains generally quiet and
      submissive. The Commander then asks the Co-Pilot to set in the Flight
      Management System some unauthorised waypoints for the approach. The
      Co-Pilot is aware of the violation but does NOT challenge the Commander
      about his/her decision and does what the Commander orders.


      How is the co-pilot behaving?

      The Pilot Monitoring (PM) observes and calls-out a deviance from the
      glide-path, but the Pilot Flying (PF) does NOT respond and does NOT make
      any required corrections. The PM continues calling-out the deviance, but
      still does NOT take control of the aircraft.
