      A pilot is approaching the destination airfield. Their radio is tuned to
      the aerodrome frequency 128.125 MHz, the transponder is set to 4272 as
      instructed and the altimeter is set to the local QNH of 1002 hPa. ATC
      issues the following clearance: “G-ABCD, surface wind 130 degrees, 5
      knots, cleared to land runway 09.”

    question: The pilot of a multi-engined aircraft has quite a high workload,
      looking out for traffic and also concentrating on following ATC
      instructions to avoid a potential traffic conflict. After a very brief
      look at the instruments, the pilot's eyes automatically focus on the
      analogue engine gauges. He/she quickly sees that one needle indicates an
      abnormally high oil pressure value for the left engine. What statement
      correctly explains how the brain is storing and processing the information
      from the instruments in the above scenario?
    options:
      - id: OMFM6QA32
        text: The visual image of the abnormal value is stored in the sensory store for
          about 1 second. The pilot automatically reacts to the abnormality by
          looking at the gauges, and then his/her attention consciously focuses
          on their indications.
