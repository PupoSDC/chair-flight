    question: |-
      The crew of an Airbus A320 is flying towards an airport in severe thunderstorms and reported wind shear conditions. Due to several aircraft going around, delays are to be expected and the crew is cleared into a holding pattern. Preoccupied with the weather ahead of them, the crew fails to notice that they have accidentally pulled back the thrust levers too far, disabling the autothrottle. As airspeed drops, and aerodynamic buffet sets in, it is interpreted by the crew as entry into turbulence. When the aircraft actually stalls, the crew is convinced to have encountered wind shear and performs the appropriate escape manoeuvre. As the manoeuvre includes applying full thrust, the crew can successfully recover from the stall and land safely.

      What is correct regarding the initial error?

      A pilot is distracted by a failure of his/her navigation equipment and consequently does not execute a planned turn, but quickly realises and corrects. Afterwards, he/she lands at his/her intermediate airport and checks the weather at his/her final destination. As the weather looks good, he/she decides to take off without loading additional fuel. When he/she encounters an unexpected headwind, he/she barely makes it to his/her final destination without any fuel left. What were the errors committed?
