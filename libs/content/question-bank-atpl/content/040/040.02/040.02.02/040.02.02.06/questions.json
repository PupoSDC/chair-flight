Which of the following are accetable explanation for why the pilot made violation?\n1. The pilot did not properly assess the risk of the spatial disorientation while entering into IMC.2. The pilot made poor assesment of the environmental situation, and as a consequence the pilot inadvertently entered IMC.3. Once the conditions reached IMC, the pilot reviewed the options. There is time to re-evaluate the situation in a degraded visual environmental before experiencing the spatial disorientation.4. The pilot failed to get an accurate meteorological pre-flight briefing, the development of options when encountering an unexpected situation takes time and may delay reaching a desicion.",

However, the pilot does not divert and tries to continue VFR but finally enters clouds (IMC). The pilot still tries to continue the planned track but contacts ATC for assistance after a few minutes.\nWhich of the following statements refer to acceptable explanations for the pilots violation?\n\n- The pilot did not properly assess the risk of spatial disorientation while entering IMC.\n\n- The pilot made a poor assessment of the environmental situation, and as a consequence the pilot inadvertently entered IMC.\n\n- Once the conditions reached IMC, the pilot reviewed the options. There is time to re-evaluate the situation in a degraded visual environment before experiencing spatial disorientation.\n\n- The pilot failed to get an accurate meteorological pre-flight briefing. The development of options when encountering an unexpected situation takes time and may delay reaching a decision.</li>\n</ol>",
