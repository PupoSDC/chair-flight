    question: >-
      The wake turbulence caused by an aircraft in flight is mainly the result
      of:


      1\. An aerodynamic effect (wing tip vortices).   
       2\. The engines action (propellers rotation or engine gas exhausts).   
       3\. The importance of the drag devices (size of the landing gear, of the flaps, etc.).
