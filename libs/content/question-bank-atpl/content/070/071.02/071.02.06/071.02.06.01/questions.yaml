    question: Following an explosive decompression, if you are using an oxygen
      diluter-demand system, the regulator controls the amount of air that is
      mixed with pure oxygen when the supply selector is at the "normal"
      position. At what approximate altitude will the regulator supply to the
      mask become pure oxygen only?
