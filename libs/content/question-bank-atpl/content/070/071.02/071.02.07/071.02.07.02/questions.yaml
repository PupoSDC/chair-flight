      A light aircraft is about to depart from a busy aerodrome. Simultaneous
      runway operations for departure are in progress, and clearance delivery
      asks the pilot which runway he/she prefers for departure. Considering the
      wind information given below, which runway should the pilot choose to
      reduce the potential of wake turbulence effects?


      For runway 25R, the wind is variable at 5 kt.   
       For runway 25C, the wind is calm.   
       For runway 25L, the wind is westerly at 3 kt.   
       For runway 18, the wind is south-westerly at 12 kt.

      1\. Establish a stabilised approach before reaching 800 ft AAL.   
       2\. Avoid excessive thrust reduction if airspeed suddenly increases.

      During take-off preparation, windshear can be predicted by observing:


      1\. Lenticular clouds close to the airfield which is located in a mountaineous area.   

      2\. Precipitation that is not reaching the surface.   

      3\. The wind sock.   

      4\. Smoke from chimneys which is divided in different directions instead of moving steadily in one direction.   

      5\. Steady rain.   

      6\. Fog.

      Observations of the prevailing meteorological conditions can help pilots
      decide whether to take off or to delay until conditions improve. 


      The following meteorological conditions would indicate the presence of low-level wind shear and would require a pilot to delay take-off:


      1\. Precipitation falling from the base of a cloud but evaporating before reaching the ground.   
       2\. Wind socks responding to different winds.   
       3\. Visible moisture and a visibility of less than 10 km.   
       4\. Strong, gusty surface winds, especially where the aerodrome is located near hills.   
       5\. Smoke plumes sheared, with upper and lower sections moving in different directions.

    question: >-
      After take-off, an aeroplane is subjected to wind shear with a decreasing
      headwind. In the absence of a pilot action, the aeroplane:


      1- flies above the climb-out path   

      2- flies below the climb-out path   

      3- has an increasing true airspeed   

      4- has a decreasing true airspeed
