    question: |-
      A turbojet aeroplane is experiencing a mid-air emergency forcing the aeroplane to make an emergency landing at the nearest suitable aerodrome. The aeroplane remains undamaged after the landing, however the pilot decides that an emergency evacuation of the passengers is required. The emergency evacuation checklist states the following:

      Parking brake: SET
