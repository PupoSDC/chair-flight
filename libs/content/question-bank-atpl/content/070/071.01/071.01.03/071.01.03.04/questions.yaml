    question: A two-engine aeroplane has an ETOPS approval for 180 minutes. Those
      180 minutes are based an the one engine inoperative speed. The departure
      aerodrome cannot be used as a take-off alternate because of meteorological
      conditions. There are no MEL restrictions. What is the maximum allowed
      flight time to the take-off alternate?

      Given the following information, state the maximum time to be used in
      order to determine the furthest distance that an adequate take-off
      alternate aerodrome may be situated from the departure aerodrome for a
      two-engine aeroplane. Assume the departure aerodrome cannot be used as a
      take-off alternate due to meteorological reasons.


      1- Approved ETOPS operational diversion time: 180 minutes   

      2- The times are determined using the One-Engine-Inoperative cruising speed according to the AFM, in still-air standard conditions based on the actual take-off mass.   

      3- No MEL restrictions apply.
