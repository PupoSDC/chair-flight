    question:
      Which of the following assessments in regard to icing and turbulence
      is true for the main cloud genera altostratus (AS) and altocumulus (AC)?
    options:
      - id: OJIWZHXLF
        text: In both types, the threat of icing is high, whereas the chance for
          turbulence is low.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OLSSPHGOY
        text: AS has a higher probability for icing and turbulence than AC.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: ORSEEQKBS
        text:
          Both AS and AC are medium level clouds. The probability for turbulence and
          icing is low.
        correct: false
        why: ""

        text:
          Flights in AS and AC may result in icing, AC has a higher probability for
          turbulence than AS.
        correct: true
