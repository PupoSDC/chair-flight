      An aircraft has just flown for 5 hours at FL410, and is performing a
      fast turnaround to depart again shortly. The fuel gauge shows -11ºC and
      the OAT is +2ºC. A warm front is approaching the airfield and the aircraft
      will depart through drizzle. What will the pilot see on the walk-around

    question:
      A pilot of a small single-engine piston aircraft is en-route in icing
      conditions. The pilot has been periodically checking the wings for ice
      accretion initially; he/she notices some slight translucent ice and the
      formation of white horns, followed shortly after that by the ice changing
      to an opaque (white) colour with a uniform thickness and some remaining
      horn formation. What are these observations typical characteristics of?

    question: A night in January has been cold and clear. In the forenoon of the

      Aircraft A is in a holding pattern, clear of cloud, based on an
      on-airfield navigation facility, at 3000 ft above the destination with the
      landing runway clearly visible from the hold. At the same time Aircraft B
      is on short final, approaching the threshold of the landing runway, when
      the pilot loses visual reference with the runway and performs a missed
      approach.
