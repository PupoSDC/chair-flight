    question:
      Which of the following statements regarding the development of valley
      inversions is correct?
    options:
      - id: OYD5NMLIH
        text:
          The most important prerequisite for the development of valley inversions
          is warm air ascending along the mountain slope, thus leaving cooler
          air behind in the bottom of the valley.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OXA9S6OKV
        text:
          The predominant factor in the development process of valley inversions is
          the non-uniformity of incident solar radiation due to orographic
          conditions in combination with density variations within the air.
        correct: false
        why: ""

        text:
          Valley inversions often are a result of radiation cooling in combination
          with gravity, both affecting the air at the surface of a mountain
          slope.
        correct: true

        text:
          Usually a valley inversion is initiated by radiation cooling and anabatic
          winds which are due to orographic conditions.
