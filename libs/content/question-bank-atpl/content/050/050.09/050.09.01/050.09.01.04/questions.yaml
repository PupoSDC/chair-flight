      An aircraft is planned to fly from Nairobi ('N', approximately 1Â°S, 37Â°E) to Manila ('M', approximately 15Â°N,121Â°E). Assuming the track follows the straight line depicted on the chart, and the cruising FL increases from initially FL370 to FL490 halfway through the flight, where along the route is it most likely to encounter a high concentration of hazardous ice crystals?
