      An aircraft has to fly over a mountain ridge. The highest obstacle, indicated in the navigation chart, has an elevation of 10 290 ft. The QNH, given by a meteorological station at an elevation of 5 100 ft, is 1013 hPa. The average temperature deviation from ISA is -20ºC.   
       What is the minimum safe flight level that should be selected to give a terrain separation of at least 2 000 feet?

    question: You are planning to fly across a mountain range. The chart recommends
      a minimum altitude of 12 000 ft above mean sea level. The air mass you
      will be flying through is an average 10°C warmer than ISA. Your altimeter
      is set to 1023 hPa (QNH of a nearby airport at nearly sea level). What
      altitude will the altimeter show when you have reached the recommended
      minimum altitude?
