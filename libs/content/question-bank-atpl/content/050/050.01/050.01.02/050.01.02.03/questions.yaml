      - id: OE71UZBQ6
        text: The air at the surface can be cooled or warmed by the process of
          conduction, which is the molecular transfer of heat between the
          surface and the air in contact with it.
        correct: true
        why: ""
      - id: OG5NOVS5Q
        text:
          The conduction of heat between the surface and the air in contact with it
          creates turbulent mixing, which is the most significant component in
          the transfer of heat to or from medium levels in the Earth's
          atmosphere.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OPU1UME85
        text:
          Turbulent mixing contributes mainly to the transfer of heat in the Earth's
          atmosphere, in the horizontal plane, but has little effect in the
          warming or cooling of the atmosphere in the vertical plane.
        correct: false

        text:
          The primary process involved in the transfer of heat upwards from the
          surface of the Earth into the upper atmosphere is turbulence, which
          exists throughout the Earth's atmosphere.

    question:
      Apart from radiation, convection, and the release of latent heat, what
      other factors influence the exchange of heat between the surface and the
      atmosphere?

        text:
          In order for heat transfer to take place between the surface and the lower
          atmosphere, both conduction and turbulence are necessary.
        correct: false
        why: ""
      - id: OXFHJEMOA
        text:
          The process of conduction is the primary mechanism by which heat is
          transferred from the surface vertically within the atmosphere to low
          or medium levels.
        correct: true
        why: ""
      - id: OAX3PYAL6
        text:
          In the mixing layer, eddy currents within the turbulence transfer heat
          from the surface upwards and, if they persist throughout the layer,
          the surface temperature gradually decreases.
        correct: false

        text:
          The molecular transfer of heat to or from the surface into the atmosphere
          takes place by conduction regardless of any temperature difference
          between the surface and the air in contact with it.

      Solar radiation is the primary source of all weather processes. When
      it interacts with the atmosphere and the earth..

        text:
          the major part remains in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is an
          effective absorber of solar radiation, temperatures in the ozone layer
          are therefore similar to surface temperatures.

        text: one part is absorbed by the atmosphere, almost all of the incoming
          radiation reaches the surface of the earth, where it is completely
          absorbed, leading to maximum temperatures at the ground.
