    question: While flying at FL390, you are required to initiate a drift down
      procedure. The maximum elevation of the highest obstacle is 29 092 ft. At
      an altitude of 5 000 ft, the QNH is measured as 1 013 hPa, and the
      temperature is ISA -15°C. What is the vertical separation between your
      aircraft and the highest obstacle?

      In a region where the transition altitude is 3000 feet, the QNH is
      reported as 980 hPa. What is the approximate reading expected on the
      altimeter when the pilot changes the subscale setting during a climb
      through the transition altitude?   
       (Assume 30 ft per 1 hPa)
