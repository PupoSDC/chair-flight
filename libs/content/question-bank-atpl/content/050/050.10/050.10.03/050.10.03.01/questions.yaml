    question: For a high level commercial air transport flight across the North
      Atlantic, the weather forecast indicated cloud and occasional moderate
      turbulence below the planned cruising level. However, some time into the
      flight the aircraft received a SIGMET broadcast indicating that a small
      area of moderate to severe clear air turbulence exists in a location close
      to the planned route. This information about the previously unexpected
      turbulence provides the flight crew with valuable advance warning,
      allowing them to make an early change to their track. What is the most
      likely basis of this SIGMET?
