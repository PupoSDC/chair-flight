      Which option correctly places, in a chronological order, the four stages
      of a mid-latitude depression life cycle? The stages are named and
      described as follows:


      Occlusion: the cold front has caught up with the warm front, the warm air has been partially lifted up.   

      Developed: fronts are well defined, there is a pronounced warm sector.   

      Cyclogenesis: a disturbance and fall in pressure causes cyclonic circulation.   

      Frontolysis: all the warm air has been lifted up.
