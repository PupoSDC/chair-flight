# Factors affecting range and accuracy

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.05.05.01** -- Define the "ILS-critical area": an area of defined
    dimensions around the LOC and GP antennas where vehicles, including
    aircraft, are excluded during all ILS operations.
2.  **062.02.05.05.02** -- Define the "ILS-sensitive area": an area extending
    beyond the ILS-critical area where the parking or movement of vehicles,
    including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable
    interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.
