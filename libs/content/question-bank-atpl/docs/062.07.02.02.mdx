# Navigation functional requirements

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.02.02.01** -- List the basic functional requirements of the RNAV
    and RNP specifications (continuous indication of lateral deviation,
    distance/bearing to active waypoint, GS or time to active waypoint,
    navigation data storage and failure indication).
