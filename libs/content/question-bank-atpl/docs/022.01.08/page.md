  What is the purpose of a synchroscope?
</Text>
<Option subject={[[]]}>Reduce vibrations</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>Avoid asymmetric flight conditions</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>Reduce fuel consumption</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>Synchronize Engine/Propeller Speed</Option>
<Option why="The goal is to reduce fuel consumption and synchronize propeller speed. This might not equate to a synchronization of fuel consumption. Imagine the case of having one engine with poorer performance. That engine will have a higher consumption in order to maintain the propellers synchronized">
  Synchronize fuel consumption
</Option>

  <Option why="The synchroscope reduces vibrations caused by having 2 engines running at slightly different frequencies. It has no usefulness to reduce vibrations of a single engine.">
    Remove vibrations from an engine.

  What statements about a synchroscope are correct?
</Text>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  It measures the difference in output frequencies of alternators placed in each
  engine.
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  It consists of a voltmeter which is fed by two tachometer-generators
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  It provides information required to set several engines at the same rotational
  speed
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>It gives information about engine speed</Option>
<Option why="A synchroscope provides engine speed in an adimensional fashion (ie.: Faster and slower).">
  It gives information about engine speed in RPM
</Option>
<Option why="A synchroscope provides engine speed in an adimensional fashion (ie.: Faster and slower).">
  It gives information about engine speed in HZ
</Option>
<Option why="A synchroscope provides information on engine speed not power">
  It gives information about engine power
</Option>
<Option why="The synchroscope allows to synchronize the RPM of 2 engines, but it does not measure RPM. rather it measures frequency generated by an alternator.">
  It mathematically subtracts RPM values of both engines
</Option>
<Option why="The synchroscope exists to reduce vibrations caused by out of sync engines, but it does not measure vibrations directly.">
  It measures the vibration values of both engines with a piezoelectric sensor
</Option>
<Option why="The synchroscope exists to reduce vibrations caused by out of sync engines, but it does not measure vibrations directly.">
  It mathematically subtracts vibration values of both engines
</Option>
<Option why="A Galvonmeter is an old-school ammeter (measures amperage). A synchroscope measures a frequency difference of 2 alternators and not their current.">
  It consists of a galvonmeter which is fed by two alternators
</Option>

  <Option why="A synchroscope simply measures the different rotation speeds of 2 engines. It does not create a communication channel directly between the 2 engines.">
    A rotor from one engine is sending frequencies to the stator of the other
    engine.
