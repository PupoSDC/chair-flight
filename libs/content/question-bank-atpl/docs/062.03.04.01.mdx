# Principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.03.04.01.01** -- State that the ATC system is based on the replies
    provided by the airborne transponders in response to interrogations from the
    ATC secondary radar.
2.  **062.03.04.01.02** -- State that the ground ATC secondary radar uses
    techniques which provide the ATC with information that cannot be acquired by
    the primary radar.
3.  **062.03.04.01.03** -- State that an airborne transponder provides
    coded-reply signals in response to interrogation signals from the ground
    secondary radar and from aircraft equipped with traffic alert and collision
    avoidance system (TCAS).
4.  **062.03.04.01.04** -- State the advantages of secondary surveillance radar
    (SSR) over a primary radar regarding range and collected information due to
    transponder principal information and active participation of the aircraft.

  Which of the following constitute an advantage of Secondary surveillance Radar
  when compared to a Primary surveillance Radar system?
</Text>
<Option
  correct
  why="As each signal only needs to follow one path (instead of all possible paths in the sky) attenuation is significantly decreased reducing power consumption"
>
  The required power of transmission from the ground equipment is reduced
</Option>
<Option
  correct
  why="Contrary to normal radars SSR relies on a response sent directly from the aircraft transponder. The best of stealth aircraft would still be clearly visible on radar, if they have their transponders on."
>
  The quality of radar identification is not dependent on the target size,
  aspect, shape, or material
</Option>
<Option
  correct
  why="Transponders communicate at least a transponder code (7000, 2000, etc...), but can also transmit altitude and identification information."
>
  Ground stations can obtain coded information from the surveilled aircraft such
  as identification and altitude
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  ATC SSR systems can interrogate aircraft transponders and elicit replies
</Option>
<Option why="This is false. SSR still requires line of sight to operate">
  Is not limited by line of sight
</Option>
<Option why="This information is not transmitted by SSR. It can be derived from multiple SSR interrogations but it's not coded information from the surveilled aircraft.">
  Ground stations can obtain coded information from the surveilled aircraft such
  as speed and heading
</Option>
<Option why="SSR still emits side lobes.">
  The relatively small ground antenna transmits no side lobes, thus eliminating
  the danger of false replies from the airborne transponder.
</Option>

  <Option why="The flow of information is the other way around. The Ground system is the one making interrogations.">
    ATC SSR systems can reply to an aircraft interrogation and provide elicit
    replies
  </Option>
