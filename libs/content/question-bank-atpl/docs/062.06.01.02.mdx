# Operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.06.01.02.01** -- State that there are currently two modes of
    operation: standard positioning service (SPS) for civilian users, and
    precise positioning service (PPS) for authorised users.
2.  **062.06.01.02.02** -- SPS was originally designed to provide civilian users
    with a less accurate positioning capability than PPS.
3.  **062.06.01.02.03** -- Name the three GNSS segments as follows: space
    segment; control segment; user segment.
4.  **062.06.01.02.04** -- State that each satellite broadcasts ranging signals
    on two UHF frequencies: L1 and L2.
5.  **062.06.01.02.05** -- State that SPS is a positioning and timing service
    provided on frequency L1.
6.  **062.06.01.02.06** -- State that PPS uses both frequencies L1 and L2.
7.  **062.06.01.02.07** -- State that the satellites transmit a coded signal
    used for ranging, identification (satellite individual PRN code), timing and
    navigation.
8.  **062.06.01.02.08** -- State that the navigation message contains:

- satellite clock correction parameters;
- Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) parameters;
- an ionospheric model;
- satellite health data.

9.  **062.06.01.02.09** -- State that an ionospheric model is used to calculate
    the time delay of the signal travelling through the ionosphere.
10. **062.06.01.02.10** -- State that two codes are transmitted on the L1
    frequency, namely a coarse acquisition (C/A) code and a precision (P) code.
    The P code is not used for standard positioning service (SPS).
11. **062.06.01.02.11** -- State that satellites are equipped with atomic clocks
    which allow the system to keep very accurate time reference.
12. **062.06.01.02.12** -- State that the control segment comprises: a master
    control station; a ground antenna; monitoring stations.
13. **062.06.01.02.13** -- State that the control segment provides: monitoring
    of the constellation status; correction of orbital parameters; navigation
    data uploading.
14. **062.06.01.02.14** -- State that GNSS supplies three-dimensional position
    fixes and speed data, plus a precise time reference.
15. **062.06.01.02.15** -- State that a GNSS receiver is able to determine the
    distance to a satellite by determining the difference between the time of
    transmission by the satellite and the time of reception.
16. **062.06.01.02.16** -- State that the initial distance calculated to the
    satellites is called pseudo-range because the difference between the GNSS
    receiver and the satellite time references initially creates an erroneous
    range.
17. **062.06.01.02.17** -- State that each range defines a sphere with its
    centre at the satellite.
18. **062.06.01.02.18** -- State that there are four unknown parameters (x, y, z
    and Delta t) (receiver clock error) which require the measurement of ranges
    to four different satellites in order to get the position.
19. **062.06.01.02.19** -- State that the GNSS receiver is able to synchronise
    to the correct time reference when receiving four satellites.
20. **062.06.01.02.20** -- State that the receiver is able to calculate aircraft
    ground speed using the space vehicle (SV) Doppler frequency shift or the
    change in receiver position over time.
21. **062.06.01.02.21** -- Define "receiver autonomous integrity monitoring
    (RAIM)" as a technique that ensures the integrity of the provided data by
    redundant measurements.
22. **062.06.01.02.22** -- State that RAIM is achieved by consistency checks
    among range measurements.
23. **062.06.01.02.23** -- State that basic RAIM requires five satellites. A
    sixth one is for isolating a faulty satellite from the navigation solution.
24. **062.06.01.02.24** -- State that agreements have been concluded between the
    appropriate agencies for the compatibility and interoperability by any
    approved user of NAVSTAR and GLONASS systems.
25. **062.06.01.02.25** -- State that the different GNSSs use different data
    with respect to reference systems, orbital data, and navigation services.
