# Engine lubrication

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.11.03.03.01** -- State the tasks of an engine lubrication system.
2.  **021.11.03.03.02** -- Name the following main components of a lubrication
    system and state their function: oil tank and centrifugal breather; oil
    pumps (pressure and scavenge pumps); oil filters (including the bypass); oil
    sumps; chip detectors; coolers.
3.  **021.11.03.03.03** -- Explain that each spool is fitted with at least one
    ball bearing and two or more roller bearings.
4.  **021.11.03.03.04** -- Explain the use of compressor air in oil-sealing
    systems (e.g. labyrinth seals).
