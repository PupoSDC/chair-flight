# Advantages and disadvantages

## Learning Objectives

1.  **040.03.07.01.01** -- Compare the two basic concepts of automation: as per
    Boeing, where the pilot remains the last operator; and as per Airbus, where
    automated systems can correct erroneous pilot action.
2.  **040.03.07.01.02** -- Explain the fundamental restrictions of autoflight
    systems to be lack of creativity in unknown situations, and lack of personal
    motivation with regard to safety.
3.  **040.03.07.01.03** -- List the principal strengths and weaknesses of pilot
    versus autopilot systems to be creativity, decision-making, prioritisation
    of tasks, safety attitude versus precision, reliability.
4.  **040.03.07.01.04** -- Explain the "ironies of automation": designers"
    errors due to wrong interpretation of the data, leaving tasks to the pilot
    that are too complex to automate, loss of manual and cognitive skills of the
    pilot. State the necessity for regular training flights as one possible
    countermeasure.
5.  **040.03.07.01.05** -- Describe methods to overcome the drawbacks of
    autoflight systems to be loss of manual flying capabilities, additional
    workload through programming, risk of slips during programming, and
    hypovigilance during cruise.
