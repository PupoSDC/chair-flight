# Integrated health and usage monitoring system (IHUMS): design, operation, performance

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.14.03.02.01** -- Describe the main features of an IHUMS: rotor system
    health; cockpit voice recorder (CVR)/flight data recorder (FDR); gearbox
    system health; engine health; exceedance monitoring; usage monitoring;
    transparent operation; ground station features; monitoring; rotor track and
    balance; engine performance trending; quality controlled to level 2.
2.  **022.14.03.02.02** -- Describe the ground station features of an IHUMS.
3.  **022.14.03.02.03** -- Summarise the benefits of an IHUMS including: reduced
    risk of catastrophic failure of rotor or gearbox; improved rotor track and
    balance giving lower vibration levels; accurate recording of flight
    exceedances; CVR/FDR allows accurate accident/incident investigation and
    HOMP; maintenance cost savings.
4.  **022.14.03.02.04** -- State the benefits of an IHUMS and an HOMP.
