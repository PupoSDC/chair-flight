# Leading-edge devices and the reasons for their use in take-off and landing

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.01.09.02.01** -- From the given relevant diagrams, describe or
    identify the different types of leading-edge high-lift devices: Krueger
    flaps; variable camber flaps; slats.
2.  **081.01.09.02.02** -- Describe the function of the slot.
3.  **081.01.09.02.03** -- Describe how the wing"s effective camber increases
    with a leading-edge flap.
4.  **081.01.09.02.04** -- Explain the effect of leading-edge flaps on the stall
    speed, also in comparison with trailing-edge flaps.
5.  **081.01.09.02.05** -- Compare their influence on the CL-alpha graph,
    compared with trailing-edge flaps and a clean wing: indicate the effect of
    leading-edge devices on CLMAX; explain how the CL curve differs from that of
    a clean wing; indicate the effect of leading-edge devices on alphaCRIT.
6.  **081.01.09.02.06** -- Compare their influence on the CL-CD graph.
7.  **081.01.09.02.07** -- Describe slat asymmetry: describe the effect on
    aeroplane controllability.
8.  **081.01.09.02.08** -- Explain the reasons for using leading-edge high-lift
    devices on take-off and landing: explain the disadvantage of increased
    nose-up attitudes; explain why take-off and landing speeds/distances are
    reduced.
