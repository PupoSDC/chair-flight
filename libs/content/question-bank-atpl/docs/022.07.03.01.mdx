# General principles and operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.07.03.01.01** -- Explain the general principles and operation of an
    SAS with regard to: rate damping; short-term attitude hold; effect on static
    stability; effect on dynamic stability; aerodynamic cross-coupling; effect
    on manoeuvrability; control response; engagement/disengagement; authority.
2.  **022.07.03.01.02** -- Explain and describe the general working principles
    and primary use of an SAS by damping pitch, roll and yaw motions.
3.  **022.07.03.01.03** -- Describe a simple SAS with force trim system which
    uses magnetic clutch and springs to hold cyclic control in the position
    where it was last released.
4.  **022.07.03.01.04** -- Explain the interaction of trim with SAS/stability
    and control augmentation system (SCAS).
5.  **022.07.03.01.05** -- Appreciate that the system can be overridden by the
    pilot and that individual channels can be deselected.
6.  **022.07.03.01.06** -- Describe the operational limits of the system.
7.  **022.07.03.01.07** -- Explain why the system should be turned off in severe
    turbulence or when extreme flight attitudes are reached.
8.  **022.07.03.01.08** -- Explain the safety design features built into some
    SASs to limit the authority of the actuators to 10-20 per cent of the
    full-control throw in order to allow the pilot to override if actuators
    demand an unsafe control input.
9.  **022.07.03.01.09** -- Explain how cross-coupling produces an adverse effect
    on roll-to-yaw coupling when the helicopter is subjected to gusts.
10. **022.07.03.01.10** -- Explain the collective-to-pitch coupling,
    side-slip-to-pitch coupling and inter-axis coupling.
