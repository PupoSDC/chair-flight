# Performance and safety

## Learning Objectives

1.  **032.01.01.03.01** -- State that aeroplane performance required for
    commercial air transport may limit the weight of a dispatched aeroplane in
    order to achieve a sufficient level of safety.
2.  **032.01.01.03.02** -- Describe that the minimum level of safety required
    for commercial air transport is ensured through the combination of
    airworthiness requirements and operational limitations, i.e. the more
    stringent airworthiness requirements of CS-25 enable a wider range of
    operating conditions for these aeroplanes.
