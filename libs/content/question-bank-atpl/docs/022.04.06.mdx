# Solid-state systems - attitude and heading reference system (AHRS)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.04.06.01.01** -- Explain that the AHRS is a replacement for
    traditional gyros using solid-state technology with no moving parts and is a
    single unit consisting of: solid-state accelerometers; solid-state rate
    sensor gyroscopes; solid-state magnetometers (measurement of the Earth"s
    magnetic field).
2.  **022.04.06.01.02** -- Explain that the AHRS senses rotation and
    acceleration for all three axes and senses the direction of the Earth"s
    magnetic field where the indications are normally provided on electronic
    screens (electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)).
