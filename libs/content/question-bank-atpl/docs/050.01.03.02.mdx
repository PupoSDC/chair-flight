# Pressure variation with height, contours (isohypses)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **050.01.03.02.01** -- Explain the pressure variation with height.
2.  **050.01.03.02.02** -- Describe quantitatively the variation of the
    barometric lapse rate. Remark: An approximation of the average value for the
    barometric lapse rate near mean sea level (MSL) is 30 ft (9 m) per 1 hPa.
3.  **050.01.03.02.03** -- State that (under conditions of ISA) pressure is
    approximately 50 per cent of MSL at 18 000 ft and density is approximately
    50 per cent of MSL at 22 000 ft and 25 per cent of MSL at 40 000 ft.
