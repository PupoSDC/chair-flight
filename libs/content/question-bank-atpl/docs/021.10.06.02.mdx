# Design, operation, indications and warnings

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.10.06.02.01** -- State the functions of a piston-engine lubrication
    system.
2.  **021.10.06.02.02** -- Describe the working principle of a dry-sump
    lubrication system and describe the functions of the following components:
    oil tank (reservoir) and its internal components: hot well, de-aerator,
    vent, expansion space; check valve (non-return valve); pressure pump and
    pressure-relief valve; scavenge pump; filters (suction, pressure and
    scavenge); oil cooler; oil cooler bypass valve (anti-surge and
    thermostatic); pressure and temperature sensors; lines.
3.  **021.10.06.02.03** -- Describe a wet-sump lubrication system.
4.  **021.10.06.02.04** -- State the differences between a wet- and a dry-sump
    lubrication system and their advantages and disadvantages.
5.  **021.10.06.02.05** -- List the following factors that influence oil
    consumption: oil grade; cylinder and piston wear; condition of piston rings.
6.  **021.10.06.02.06** -- Describe the interaction between oil pressure, oil
    temperature and oil quantity.
