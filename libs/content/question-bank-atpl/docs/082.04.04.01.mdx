# Airflow in ground effect, downwash

## Learning Objectives

1.  **082.04.04.01.01** -- Explain how the vicinity of the ground changes the
    downward flow pattern and the consequences on lift (thrust) at constant
    rotor power. Show that ground effect depends on the height of the rotor
    above the ground and the rotor diameter. Show the required rotor power at
    constant all-up mass (AUM) as a function of height above the ground.
    Describe the influence of forward speed.
