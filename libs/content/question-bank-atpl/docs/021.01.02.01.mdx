# Stress, strain and loads

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.01.02.01.01** -- Explain how stress and strain are always present in
    an aircraft structure both when parked and during manoeuvring. Remark:
    Stress is the internal force per unit area inside a structural part as a
    result of external loads. Strain is the deformation caused by the action of
    stress on a material.
2.  **021.01.02.01.02** -- Describe the following types of loads that an
    aircraft may be subjected to, when they occur, and how a pilot may affect
    their magnitude:
    - static loads;
    - dynamic loads;
    - cyclic loads.
3.  **021.01.02.01.03** -- Describe the areas typically prone to stress that
    should be given particular attention during a pre-flight inspection, and
    highlight the limited visual cues of any deformation that may be evident.
