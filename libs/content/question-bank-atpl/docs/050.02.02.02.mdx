# Variation of wind in the friction layer

## Learning Objectives

1.  **050.02.02.02.01** -- Describe why and how the wind changes direction and
    speed with height in the friction layer in the northern and in the southern
    hemisphere (rule of thumb).
2.  **050.02.02.02.02** -- State the surface and air-mass conditions that
    influence the wind in the friction layer (diurnal variation).
3.  **050.02.02.02.03** -- Name terrain, wind speed and stability as the main
    factors that influence the vertical extent of the friction layer.
4.  **050.02.02.02.04** -- Explain the relationship between isobars and wind
    (direction and speed). Remark: Approximate value for variation of wind in
    the friction layer (values to be used in examinations): Type of landscape:
    Wind speed in friction layer in per cent of the geostrophic wind: over
    water: ca. 70 per cent; over land: ca. 50 per cent; The wind in the friction
    layer blows across the isobars towards the low pressure. Angle between wind
    direction and isobars. Over water: ca. 10 degrees; over land: ca. 30
    degrees. WMO - No. 266.
