# Conditions for ice accretion

## Learning Objectives

1.  **050.09.01.01.01** -- Summarise the general conditions under which ice
    accretion occurs on aircraft (temperatures of outside air; temperature of
    the airframe; presence of supercooled water in clouds, fog, rain and
    drizzle; possibility of sublimation).
2.  **050.09.01.01.02** -- Explain the general weather conditions under which
    ice accretion occurs in a venturi carburettor.
3.  **050.09.01.01.03** -- Explain the general weather conditions under which
    ice accretion occurs on airframe.
4.  **050.09.01.01.04** -- Explain the formation of supercooled water in clouds,
    rain and drizzle. (Refer to Subject 050 03 02 01.
5.  **050.09.01.01.05** -- Explain qualitatively the relationship between the
    air temperature and the amount of supercooled water.
6.  **050.09.01.01.06** -- Explain qualitatively the relationship between the
    type of cloud and the size and number of the droplets in cumuliform and
    stratiform clouds.
7.  **050.09.01.01.07** -- Indicate in which circumstances ice can form on an
    aircraft on the ground: air temperature, humidity, precipitation.
8.  **050.09.01.01.08** -- Explain in which circumstances ice can form on an
    aircraft in flight: inside clouds, in precipitation, and outside clouds and
    precipitation.
9.  **050.09.01.01.09** -- Explain the influence of fuel temperature, radiative
    cooling of the aircraft surface and temperature of the aircraft surface
    (e.g. from previous flight) on ice formation.
10. **050.09.01.01.10** -- Describe the different factors that influence the
    intensity of icing: air temperature, amount of supercooled water in a cloud
    or in precipitation, amount of ice crystals in the air, speed of the
    aircraft, shape (thickness) of the airframe parts (wings, antennas, etc.).
11. **050.09.01.01.11** -- Explain the effects of topography on icing.
12. **050.09.01.01.12** -- Explain the higher concentration of water drops in
    stratiform orographic clouds.
