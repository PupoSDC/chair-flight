# Loads, stresses and aeroelastic vibrations (flutter)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.02.03.03.01** -- Describe the vertical and horizontal loads on the
    ground and during normal flight.
2.  **021.02.03.03.02** -- Describe the vertical and horizontal loads during
    asymmetric flight following an engine failure for a multi-engine aeroplane,
    and how a pilot may potentially overstress the structure during the failure
    scenario.
3.  **021.02.03.03.03** -- Explain the principle of flutter and resonance for
    the wing and control surfaces.
4.  **021.02.03.03.04** -- Explain the following countermeasures used to achieve
    stress relief and reduce resonance: chord-wise and span-wise position of
    masses (e.g. engines, fuel, balance masses for wing and control balance
    masses); torsional stiffness; bending flexibility; fuel-balancing procedures
    during flight (automatic or applied by the pilot).
