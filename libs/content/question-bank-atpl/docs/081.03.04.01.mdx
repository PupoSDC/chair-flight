# Recognition and explanation of stalled condition

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.03.04.01.01** -- Explain why a stalled condition can occur at any
    airspeed, or attitude or altitude.
2.  **081.03.04.01.02** -- Explain that a stall may be recognised by continuous
    stall-warning activation accompanied by at least one of the following:
    buffet, that can be heavy; lack of pitch authority; uncommanded pitch down
    and uncommanded roll; inability to arrest the descent rate.
3.  **081.03.04.01.03** -- Explain that "stall warning" means a natural or
    synthetic indication provided when approaching the stall that may include
    one or more of the following indications: aerodynamic buffeting; reduced
    roll stability and aileron effectiveness; visual or aural clues and
    warnings; reduced elevator (pitch) authority; inability to maintain altitude
    or arrest a rate of descent; stick-shaker activation.
