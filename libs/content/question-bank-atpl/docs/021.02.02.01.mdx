# Composite and other materials

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.02.02.01.01** -- Explain the principle of a composite material, and
    give examples of typical non-metallic materials used on aircraft: carbon;
    glass; Kevlar aramid; resin or filler.
2.  **021.02.02.01.02** -- State the advantages and disadvantages of composite
    materials compared with metal alloys by considering the following:
    strength-to-weight ratio; capability to tailor the strength to the direction
    of the load; stiffness; electrical conductivity (lightning); resistance to
    fatigue and corrosion; resistance to cost; discovering damage during a
    pre-flight inspection.
3.  **021.02.02.01.03** -- State that several types of materials are used on
    aircraft and that they are chosen based on type of structure or component
    and the required/desired material properties.
