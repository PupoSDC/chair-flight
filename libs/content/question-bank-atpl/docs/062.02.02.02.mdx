# Presentation and interpretation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.02.02.01** -- Name the types of indicators commonly in use:
    electronic display; radio magnetic indicator (RMI); fixed-card ADF (radio
    compass); moving-card ADF.
2.  **062.02.02.02.02** -- Interpret the indications given on RMI, fixed-card
    and moving-card ADF displays.
3.  **062.02.02.02.03** -- Given a display, interpret the relevant ADF
    information.
4.  **062.02.02.02.04** -- Calculate the true bearing from the compass heading
    and relative bearing.
5.  **062.02.02.02.05** -- Convert the compass bearing into magnetic bearing and
    true bearing.
6.  **062.02.02.02.06** -- Describe how to fly the following in-flight ADF
    procedures: homing and tracking, and explain the influence of wind;
    interception of inbound QDM and outbound QDR; changing from one QDM/QDR to
    another; determining station passage and the abeam point.

  <Explanation>
    Keep in mind this question is not necessarily asking what is the best way to get navigate towards
    the NDB rather, it wants to test if you know the 2 established procedures **Homing** and **Tracking**.

    A good way to learn the difference between the 2 is learning about Homing and Tracking missiles (the
    type fighter jets use). A homing missile is a simple design it basically keeps the missile target
    on "center", making no effort to compensate for wind, the target movement or anything else. This
    is extremely inefficient and will cause the missile to follow a non-optimal path.

    A tracking missile is a bit smarter than that: It continuously calculates the target position and
    it's position and where the 2 will meet, so that any given time a missile is flying the optimal
    path to its target.

    Dropping out of Top Gun:

    *   When **homing** you keep the ADF marking 0ยบ. The goal here is to get to the target for sure,
        regardless of the convoluted path you take there.
    *   When **tracking** you take into account the wind and correct for that by applying a Correction
        equal to the drift angle. This relies on you having access to precise drift angle information.
