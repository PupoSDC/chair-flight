# Direct-reading magnetic compass

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.03.03.01.01** -- Explain the purpose of a direct-reading magnetic
    compass.
2.  **022.03.03.01.02** -- Describe how the direct-reading magnetic compass will
    only show correct indications during straight, level and unaccelerated
    flight, and that an error will occur during the following flight manoeuvres
    (no numerical examples): acceleration and deceleration; turning; during
    pitch-up or pitch-down manoeuvres.
3.  **022.03.03.01.03** -- Explain how the use of timed turns eliminates the
    problem of the turning errors of a direct-reading magnetic compass, and
    calculate the duration of a rate-1 turn for a given change of heading.
4.  **022.03.03.01.04** -- Describe the serviceability check for a
    direct-reading magnetic compass prior to flight, such as: the physical
    appearance of the device; comparing the indication to another known
    direction such as a different compass or runway direction.

## Summary

<Question id="S62T6YB1FB" lo={["022.03.03.01.04"]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    Your aircraft is lined up Runway 25, which is aligned with a magnetic
    bearing of 253º. You notice that the direct reading magnetic compass reads
    <Subject />. What should you do?
  </Text>
<Option
  subject={[["264ºM"]]}
  why="The maximum tolerable error for a direct reading magnetic compass is 10º"
>
  Cancel the flight and return to maintenance
</Option>
<Option
  subject={[["262ºM"]]}
  why="The maximum tolerable error for a direct reading magnetic compass is 10º"
>
  Continue the flight normally.
</Option>
<Option why="Magnetic compasses can not be directly adjustable.">
  Manually adjust the compass until it reads a bearing of 253ºM.
</Option>

  <Option why="If the direct reading compass is indeed INOP, you can not fly.">
    Continue the flight but consider the instrument as INOP
  </Option>
