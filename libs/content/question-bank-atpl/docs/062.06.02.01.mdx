# Ground-based augmentation systems (GBASs)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.06.02.01.01** -- Explain the principle of a GBAS: to measure on the
    ground the errors in the signals transmitted by GNSS satellites and relay
    the measured errors to the user for correction.
2.  **062.06.02.01.02** -- State that the ICAO GBAS standard is based on this
    technique through the use of a data link in the VHF band of ILS-VOR systems
    (108-118 MHz).
3.  **062.06.02.01.03** -- State that for a GBAS station the coverage is about
    20 NM.
4.  **062.06.02.01.04** -- State that GBAS provides information for guidance in
    the terminal area, and for three-dimensional guidance in the final approach
    segment (FAS) by transmitting the FAS data block.
5.  **062.06.02.01.05** -- State that one ground station can support all the
    aircraft subsystems within its coverage providing the aircraft with approach
    data, corrections and integrity information for GNSS satellites in view via
    a VHF data broadcast (VDB).
6.  **062.06.02.01.06** -- State that the minimum software designed coverage
    area is 10 degrees on either side of the final approach path to a distance
    between 15 and 20 NM, and 35 degrees on either side of the final approach
    path up to a distance of 15 NM.
7.  **062.06.02.01.07** -- State that outside this area the FAS data of GBAS is
    not used.
8.  **062.06.02.01.08** -- State that GBAS based on GPS is sometimes called
    local area augmentation system (LAAS).
9.  **062.06.02.01.09** -- State that a GBAS-based approach is called GLS
    approach (GLS-GNSS landing system).
