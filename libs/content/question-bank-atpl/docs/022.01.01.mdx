1.  **022.01.01.01.01** -- Define "pressure", "absolute pressure" and
    "differential pressure".
2.  **022.01.01.01.02** -- List the following units used for pressure
    measurement: Pascal; bar; inches of mercury (in Hg); pounds per square inch
    (psi).
3.  **022.01.01.01.03** -- State the relationship between the different units.
4.  **022.01.01.01.04** -- List and describe the following different types of
    sensors used according to the pressure to be measured: aneroid capsules;
    bellows; diaphragms; bourdon tube.
5.  **022.01.01.01.05** -- Identify pressure measurements that are applicable to
    an aircraft: liquid-pressure measurement (fuel, oil, hydraulic);
    air-pressure measurement (bleed-air systems, air-conditioning systems);
    engine-pressure measurement manifold pressure (MAP), engine pressure ratio
    (EPR)).
6.  **022.01.01.01.06** -- Identify and read pressure measurement indications
    both for engine indications and other systems.
7.  **022.01.01.01.07** -- Explain the implications of the following pressure
    measurement errors both for engine indications and other systems: loss of
    pressure sensing; incorrect pressure indications.

<Question id="HISBNGA4GS" lo={[""]}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">Parallax error is:</Text>
  <Option>due to temperature effect</Option>
  <Option correct>a reading error</Option>
  <Option>due to the effect of aircraft accelerations</Option>
  <Option>due to pressure effect</Option>

  <Explanation>
    Parallax error, is an error that can occur by looking at a mechanical
    instrument that is not directly in front of you. There is a gap between the
    needle and the display marks, meaning that if you read the instrument at an
    angle it will appear as if the needle is indicating a different value from
    the correct one.

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    How is <Subject /> indicated in the cockpit
  </Text>
<Option
  subject={[["Hydraulic Pressure"]]}
  why="A Bourdon tube is used to measure high pressure values, like the hydraulic system pressure."
>
  By a Bourdon Tube
</Option>
<Option
  subject={[["Manifold Pressure"]]}
  why="A Bellows sensor is used for measuring medium-range pressure and differential pressures, like for measuring MAP."
>
  By a Bellows sensor
</Option>
<Option
  subject={[["Altitude"]]}
  why="Altitude is derived from static pressure which is measured by an aneroid capsule"
>
  By an aneroid capsule
</Option>
<Option why="This answer mixes 2 different sensors that are used for different pressure ">
  By a bellows via a mechanical sensing from a Bourdon tube
</Option>

  <Option why="This answer is not necessarily wrong, but it's a bit inconsequential: It describe all electrical pressure measurement systems. This question is trying to see if you know what type of sensor is used for what instruments.">
    By Electrical signals generated by a pressure sensing element in a remote
    location.
