## Learning Objectives

1.  **010.09.04.03.01** -- Describe the mechanical safety considerations
    regarding elevated approach lights and elevated RWY, SWY and TWY lights.
2.  **010.09.04.03.02** -- List the conditions for the installation of an
    aerodrome beacon (ABN) and describe its general characteristics.
3.  **010.09.04.03.03** -- Describe the different kinds of operations for which
    a simple approach lighting system shall be used.
4.  **010.09.04.03.04** -- Describe the basic installations of a simple approach
    lighting system including the dimensions and distances normally used.
5.  **010.09.04.03.05** -- Describe the principle of a precision approach
    category I lighting system including information such as location and
    characteristics.
6.  **010.09.04.03.06** -- Describe the principle of a precision approach
    category II and III lighting system including information such as location
    and characteristics, especially the inner 300 m of the system.
7.  **010.09.04.03.07** -- Describe the wing bars of the precision approach path
    indicator (PAPI) and the abbreviated precision approach path indicator
    (APAPI). Interpret what the pilot will see during the approach using PAPI.
8.  **010.09.04.03.08** -- Interpret what the pilot will see during an approach
    using a helicopter approach path indicator (HAPI).
9.  **010.09.04.03.09** -- Explain the application and characteristics (as
    applicable, but limited to colour, intensity, direction and whether fixed or
    flashing) of: RWY-edge lights; RWY-THR and wing-bar lights; RWY-end lights;
    RWY-centre-line lights; RWY-lead-in lights; RWY-TDZ lights; SWY lights;
    TWY-centre-line lights; TWY-edge lights; stop bars; intermediate holding
    position lights; RWY guard lights; road holding position lights.
10. **010.09.04.03.10** -- State the timescale within which aeronautical ground
    lights shall be made available to arriving aircraft.
