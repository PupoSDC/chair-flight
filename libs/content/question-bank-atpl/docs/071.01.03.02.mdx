# Transoceanic and polar flights (ICAO Doc 7030 "Regional Supplementary Procedures - North Atlantic Operations and Airspace Manual")

## Learning Objectives

1.  **071.01.03.02.01** -- According to ICAO Doc 7030, explain that special
    rules apply to the North Atlantic (NAT) Region, and crews need to be
    specifically trained before flying in this area.
2.  **071.01.03.02.02** -- Describe the possible indications of navigation
    system degradation, including any system-generated warning.
3.  **071.01.03.02.03** -- Describe by what emergency means course and inertial
    navigation system (INS) can be cross-checked in the case of three navigation
    systems and two navigation systems.
4.  **071.01.03.02.04** -- Describe the general ICAO procedures applicable in
    NAT airspace if the aircraft is unable to continue the flight in accordance
    with its air traffic control (ATC) clearance.
5.  **071.01.03.02.05** -- Describe the ICAO procedures applicable in NAT
    airspace in case of radio-communication failure.
6.  **071.01.03.02.06** -- Describe the recommended initial action if an
    aircraft is unable to obtain a revised ATC clearance.
7.  **071.01.03.02.07** -- Describe the subsequent action for aircraft able to
    maintain assigned flight level and for aircraft unable to maintain assigned
    flight level.
8.  **071.01.03.02.08** -- Describe determination of tracks and courses for
    random routes in NAT airspace.
9.  **071.01.03.02.09** -- Specify the method by which planned tracks are
    defined (by latitude and longitude) in the NAT airspace: when operating
    predominately in an east–west direction south of 70 degrees N, and when
    operating predominately in an east–west direction north of 70 degrees N.
10. **071.01.03.02.10** -- State the maximum flight time recommended between
    significant points on random routes.
11. **071.01.03.02.11** -- Specify the method by which planned tracks for random
    routes are defined for flights operating predominantly in a north–south
    direction.
12. **071.01.03.02.12** -- Describe how the desired random route must be
    specified in the ATC flight plan.
13. **071.01.03.02.13** -- Describe what precautions can be taken when operating
    in the area of compass unreliability as a contingency against INS failure.
