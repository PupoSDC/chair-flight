# Designation of RNP and RNAV specifications

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.02.03.01** -- Interpret X in RNAV X or RNP X as the lateral
    navigation (LNAV) accuracy (total system error) in nautical miles, which is
    expected to be achieved at least 95 per cent of the flight time by the
    population of aircraft operating within the given airspace, route or
    procedure.
2.  **062.07.02.03.02** -- State that aircraft approved to the more stringent
    accuracy requirements may not necessarily meet some of the functional
    requirements of the navigation specification that has a less stringent
    accuracy requirement.
3.  **062.07.02.03.03** -- State that RNAV 10 and RNP 4 are used in the
    oceanic/remote phase of flight.
4.  **062.07.02.03.04** -- State that RNAV 5 is used in the en-route and arrival
    phases of flight.
5.  **062.07.02.03.05** -- State that RNAV 2 and RNP 2 are also used as
    navigation specifications.
6.  **062.07.02.03.06** -- State that RNP 2 is used in the en-route and
    oceanic/remote phases of flight.
7.  **062.07.02.03.07** -- State that RNAV 2 might be used in the en-route
    continental, arrival and departure phases of flight.
8.  **062.07.02.03.08** -- State that RNAV 1 and RNP 1 are used in the arrival
    and departure phases of flight.
9.  **062.07.02.03.09** -- State that required navigation performance approach
    (RNP APCH) is used in the approach phase of flight.
10. **062.07.02.03.10** -- State that required navigation performance
    authorisation required approach (RNP AR APCH) is used in the approach phase
    of flight.
11. **062.07.02.03.11** -- State that RNP 0.3 navigation specification is used
    in all phases of flight except for oceanic/remote and final approach,
    primarily for helicopters.
12. **062.07.02.03.12** -- State that RNAV 1, RNP 1 and RNP 0.3 may also be used
    in en-route phases of low-level instrument flight rule (IFR) helicopter
    flights.

## Summary

### RNAV and RNP specifications

The specifications are ordered here from the most demanding to the least
demanding segements (Approach being the most demanding, and oceanic being the
least).
