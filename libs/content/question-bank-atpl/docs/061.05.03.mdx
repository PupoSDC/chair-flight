# Sunrise and sunset

## Learning Objectives

1.  **061.05.03.01.01** -- Define sunrise, sunset, and civil twilight, and
    extract times from a suitable source (e.g. an almanac).
2.  **061.05.03.01.02** -- Explain the changes to sunrise, sunset, and civil
    twilight times with date, latitude and altitude.
3.  **061.05.03.01.03** -- Explain at which time of the year the duration of
    daylight changes at the highest rate.

## Summary

### Daylight change rate

The hours of daylight varies during the year in a sinusoidal fashion. As such,
given the peaks of daylight happen at the solstices, the points with the highest
rate of change will be 3 months before and after a solstices, known as the
equinoxes. This can be observed in a graph by noting the moment where the
inclination of the curve is the highest.

  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    Which of the following statements is correct?
  </Text>
<Option key="1" subject={[[]]}>
  The rate of change of the duration of daylight is greatest during the
  equinoxes because the rate of change of the duration of daylight is directly
  proportional to the declination of the sun.
</Option>
<Option key="2" subject={[[]]}>
  The rate of change of the duration of daylight is shortest during the
  solstices because the rate of change of the duration of daylight is directly
  proportional to the declination of the sun.
