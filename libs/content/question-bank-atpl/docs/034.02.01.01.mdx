# Effect of variables on SE helicopter performance

## Learning Objectives

1.  **034.02.01.01.01** -- Determine the wind component, altitude and
    temperature for hovering, take-off and landing.
2.  **034.02.01.01.02** -- Explain that operations are to be conducted only
    from/to heliports and over such routes, areas and diversions contained in a
    non-hostile environment where a safe forced landing can be carried out
    (point CAT.OP.MPA.137 of the EU Regulation on air operations, except when
    the helicopter is approved to operate in accordance with point
    CAT.POL.H.420.. (Consider the exception: Operations may be conducted in a
    hostile environment. Ground level exposure - and exposure for elevated final
    approach and take-off areas (FATOs) or helidecks in non-hostile
    environments - is allowed for operations approved under CAT.POL.H.305,
    during the take-off and landing phases.)
3.  **034.02.01.01.03** -- Explain the effect of temperature, wind and altitude
    on climb, cruise and descent performance.
