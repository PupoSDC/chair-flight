# Convergence

## Learning Objectives

1.  **061.04.01.02.01** -- Explain and calculate the constant of the cone (sine
    of parallel of origin).
2.  **061.04.01.02.02** -- Explain the relationship between Earth and chart
    convergence with respect to the ICAO requirement for a straight line to
    approximate a great circle.

## Summary

### Chart vs Earth convergence

Earth meridian convergence is the difference in inclination between two
meridians on the earth or the change in true track (direction) of a **great
circle** between two meridians on the earth.

Chart meridian convergence is the difference in inclination between two
meridians on a chart or the change in true track (direction) of a **straight
line** between two meridians on a chart.
