# Explain why buffet or stall occurs

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.03.03.01.01** -- Explain why buffet or stall could occur in the
    following pilot-induced situations, and the methods to mitigate them:
    inappropriate take-off configuration, detailing the consequences of errors
    associated with leading-edge devices; steep turns; go-around using
    take-off/go-around (TOGA) setting (underslung engines).
2.  **081.03.03.01.02** -- Explain why buffet or stall could occur in the
    following environmental conditions at low altitude, and how to mitigate
    them: thunderstorms; wind shear and microburst; turbulence; wake turbulence;
    icing conditions.
3.  **081.03.03.01.03** -- Explain why buffet or stall could occur in the
    following environmental conditions at high altitude, and how to mitigate
    them: thunderstorms in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ); jet
    streams; clear-air turbulence.
4.  **081.03.03.01.04** -- Explain why buffet or stall could occur in the
    following situations, and how to mitigate them: inappropriate autopilot
    climb mode; loss of, or unreliable, airspeed indication.
