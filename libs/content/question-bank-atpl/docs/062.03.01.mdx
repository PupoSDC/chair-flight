# Pulse techniques

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.03.01.01.01** -- Name the different applications of radar with respect
    to air traffic control (ATC), weather observations, and airborne weather
    radar (AWR).
2.  **062.03.01.01.02** -- Describe the pulse technique and echo principle on
    which primary radar systems are based.
3.  **062.03.01.01.03** -- State that the range of a radar depends on pulse
    repetition frequency (PRF), pulse length, pulse power, height of aircraft,
    height of antenna and frequency used.

  subject={[["Pulse Technique"], ["Interrogator / transponder principle"]]}
  why="DME still uses radar, although not in its name. So it's also using the Pulse Technique. It's also using the interrogator transponder principle to obtain distance between the aircraft and the ground station."

<Option
  subject={[["pulse length"]]}
  why="The pulse technique works by sending a series of pulses and then &#x22;listening&#x22; to the their echoes. While emitting a pulse the receiver is not activate to avoid picking up the emission. As such, the longer the pulse length, the longer the time the receiver needs to be turned off, and the longer the minimum range of the radar."
