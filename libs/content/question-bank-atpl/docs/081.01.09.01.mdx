# Trailing-edge flaps and the reasons for their use in take-off and landing

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.01.09.01.01** -- From the given relevant diagrams, describe or
    identify the following types of trailing-edge flaps: split flaps; plain
    flaps; slotted flaps; Fowler flaps.
2.  **081.01.09.01.02** -- Describe how the wing"s effective camber increases
    the CL and CD, and the reasons why this can be beneficial.
3.  **081.01.09.01.03** -- Describe their effect on: the location of CP;
    pitching moments (due to wing CP movement); stall speed.
4.  **081.01.09.01.04** -- Compare their influence on the CL-alpha graph:
    indicate the variation in CL at any given alpha; indicate their effect on
    CLMAX; indicate their effect on critical alpha; indicate their effect on the
    alpha at a given CL.
5.  **081.01.09.01.05** -- Compare their influence on the CL-CD graph: indicate
    how the (CL/CD)MAX differs from that of a clean wing.
6.  **081.01.09.01.06** -- Explain the influence of trailing-edge flap
    deflection on the glide angle.
7.  **081.01.09.01.07** -- Describe flap asymmetry: explain the effect on
    aeroplane controllability.
8.  **081.01.09.01.08** -- Describe trailing-edge flap effect on take-off and
    landing: explain the advantages of lower-nose attitudes; explain why
    take-off and landing speeds/distances are reduced.
9.  **081.01.09.01.09** -- Explain the effects of flap-setting errors, such as
    mis-selection and premature/late extension or retraction of flaps, on:
    take-off and landing distance and speeds; climb and descent performance;
    stall buffet margins.
