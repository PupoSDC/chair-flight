12. **071.01.03.03.12** -- State that all flights should plan to operate on
    great-circle tracks joining successive significant waypoints.
13. **071.01.03.03.13** -- State that during the hours of validity of the OTS,
    operators are encouraged to plan flights: in accordance with the OTS; or
    along a route to join or leave an outer track of the OTS; or on a random
    route to remain clear of the OTS, either laterally or vertically.
14. **071.01.03.03.14** -- State which flight levels are available on OTS tracks
    during OTS periods.
15. **071.01.03.03.15** -- State which flight levels are to be planned on random
    tracks or outside OTS periods.
16. **071.01.03.03.16** -- Selection of cruising altitude. Specify the
    appropriate cruising levels for normal long-range IFR flights and for those
    operating on the North Atlantic OTS.
17. **071.01.03.03.17** -- Intentionally left blank
18. **071.01.03.03.18** -- State that pilots should notify the oceanic area
    control centre (OAC) of the maximum acceptable flight level possible at the
    boundary.
19. **071.01.03.03.19** -- State that at some aerodromes which are situated
    close to oceanic boundaries, the oceanic clearance must be obtained before
    departure.
20. **071.01.03.03.20** -- State that if an aircraft encounters, whilst en-route
    to the NAT Oceanic Airspace, an in-flight equipment failure relevant to the
    airspace, then the pilot must advise ATC when requesting oceanic clearance.
21. **071.01.03.03.21** -- State that after obtaining and reading back the
    clearance, the pilot should monitor the forward estimate for oceanic entry,
    and if this changes by 3 minutes or more, unless providing position reports
    via automatic dependent surveillance - contract (ADS-C), the pilot must pass
    a revised estimate on to ATC.
22. **071.01.03.03.22** -- State that pilots should pay particular attention
    when the issued clearance differs from the flight plan as a significant
    proportion of navigation errors investigated in the NAT Region involve
    aircraft which have followed their flight plan rather than the differing
    clearance.
23. **071.01.03.03.23** -- State that if the entry point of the oceanic route
    for which the flight is cleared differs from that originally requested or
    the oceanic flight level differs from the current flight level, the pilot is
    responsible for requesting and obtaining the necessary domestic
    re-clearance.
24. **071.01.03.03.24** -- State that there are three elements to an oceanic
    clearance: route, speed, and flight level, and that these elements serve to
    provide for the three basic elements of separation: lateral, longitudinal,
    and vertical.
25. **071.01.03.03.25** -- Communications and position-reporting procedures
    State that pilots communicate with OACCs via aeradio stations staffed by
    communicators who have no executive ATC authority.
26. **071.01.03.03.26** -- State that messages are relayed from the ground
    station to the air traffic controllers of the relevant OACC for action.
27. **071.01.03.03.27** -- State that frequencies from the lower HF bands tend
    to be used for communications during night-time and those from the higher
    bands during daytime. When initiating contact with an aeradio station, the
    pilot should state the HF frequency in use.
28. **071.01.03.03.28** -- State that since oceanic traffic typically
    communicates with ATC through aeradio facilities, a satellite communication
    (SATVOICE) call, made due to unforeseen inability to communicate by other
    means, should be made to such a facility rather than the ATC centre, unless
    the urgency of the communication dictates otherwise.
29. **071.01.03.03.29** -- State that an air-to-air VHF frequency has been
    established for worldwide use when aircraft are out of range of VHF ground
    stations which utilise the same or adjacent frequencies. This frequency,
    123.450 MHz, is intended for pilot-to-pilot exchanges of operationally
    significant information.
30. **071.01.03.03.30** -- State that any pilot, who provides position reports
    via data link and encounters significant meteorological phenomena (such as
    moderate/severe turbulence or icing, volcanic ash or thunderstorms), should
    report this information.
31. **071.01.03.03.31** -- State that all turbine-engined aeroplanes having a
    maximum certified take-off mass exceeding 5 700 kg or authorised to carry
    more than 19 passengers are required to carry and operate airborne collision
    avoidance system (ACAS) II in the NAT Region.
32. **071.01.03.03.32** -- State that even with the growing use of data-link
    communications, a significant volume of NAT air–ground communications are
    conducted using voice on single sideband (SSB) HF frequencies. To support
    air–ground ATC communications in the North Atlantic Region, 24 HF
    frequencies have been allocated, in bands ranging from 2.8 to 18 MHz.
33. **071.01.03.03.33** -- Application of the Mach number technique (NAT HLA)
    State that practical experience has shown that when two or more turbojet
    aircraft, operating along the same route at the same flight level, maintain
    the same Mach number, they are more likely to maintain a constant time
    interval between each other than when using other methods.
34. **071.01.03.03.34** -- State that after leaving oceanic airspace, pilots
    must maintain their assigned Mach number in domestic controlled airspace
    unless and until the appropriate ATC unit authorises a change.
35. **071.01.03.03.35** -- NAT HLA flight operation and navigation procedures
    State that the pre-flight procedures for any NAT HLA flight must include a
    Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time check.
36. **071.01.03.03.36** -- Describe the function and use of the master document.
37. **071.01.03.03.37** -- State the requirements for position plotting.
38. **071.01.03.03.38** -- Describe the pre-flight procedures for: the alignment
    of IRS; the satellite navigation availability prediction programme for
    flights using global navigation satellite long-range navigation system (GNSS
    LRNS); loading of initial waypoints; and flight plan check.
39. **071.01.03.03.39** -- Describe the strategic lateral offset procedure
    (SLOP) and state that along a route or track there will be three positions
    that an aircraft may fly: centre line, or up to 2 NM right.
40. **071.01.03.03.40** -- State that RNAV 10 retains the RNP 10 designation, as
    specified in the Performance-based Navigation Manual (ICAO Doc 9613. (ICAO
    Doc 7030, NAT Chapter 4..
41. **071.01.03.03.41** -- State that both aircraft and operators must be RNP
    10- or RNP 4-approved by the State of the Operator or the State of Registry,
    as appropriate.
42. **071.01.03.03.42** -- State that RNP 10 is the minimum navigation
    specification for the application of 93 km (50 NM) lateral separation.
43. **071.01.03.03.43** -- Reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) flight in
    NAT HLA State the altimeter cross-check to be performed before entering NAT
    HLA.
44. **071.01.03.03.44** -- State the altimeter cross-check to be performed when
    entering and flying in NAT HLA.
45. **071.01.03.03.45** -- State that pilots not using controller–pilot
    data-link communications (CPDLC)/ADS-C always report to ATC immediately on
    leaving the current cruising level and on reaching any new cruising level.
46. **071.01.03.03.46** -- State that flight crew should report when a 300-ft
    deviation or more occurs.
47. **071.01.03.03.47** -- Navigation planning procedures List the factors to be
    considered by the commander before commencing the flight.
48. **071.01.03.03.48** -- For this part, consider aircraft equipped with only
    two operational LRNSs and state the requirements for the following
    situations: one system fails before take-off; one system fails before the
    OCA boundary is reached; one system fails after the OCA boundary is crossed;
    and the remaining system fails after entering NAT HLA.
49. **071.01.03.03.49** -- State the general procedures and also state that the
    general concept of these NAT in-flight contingency procedures is, whenever
    operationally feasible, to offset the assigned route by 5 NM and climb or
    descend to a level which differs from those normally used by 500 ft if below
    FL 410 or by 1 000 ft if above FL 410.
50. **071.01.03.03.50** -- State all the factors which may affect the direction
    of turn including: direction to an alternate aerodrome; terrain clearance;
    levels allocated on adjacent routes or tracks and any known SLOP offsets
    adopted by other nearby traffic.
51. **071.01.03.03.51** -- State that if the deviation around severe weather is
    to be greater than 5 NM, the assigned flight level must be changed by
    plus/minus 300 ft depending on the followed track and the direction of the
    deviation.
