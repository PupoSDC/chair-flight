# Use of reduced (flexible or flex) and derated thrust

## Learning Objectives

1.  **032.04.01.12.01** -- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using
    reduced (flex) and derated thrust.
2.  **032.04.01.12.02** -- Explain the difference between and principles behind
    reduced (flex) and derated thrust.
3.  **032.04.01.12.03** -- Explain when reduced (flex) and derated thrust may
    and may not be used.
4.  **032.04.01.12.04** -- Explain the effect of using reduced (flex) and
    derated thrust on take-off performance including take-off speeds, take-off
    distance, climb performance and obstacle clearance.
5.  **032.04.01.12.05** -- Explain the assumed temperature method for
    determining reduced (flex) thrust performance.
