# Aeroplane condition monitoring system (ACMS): general, design, operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.14.03.03.01** -- State the purpose of an ACMS.
2.  **022.14.03.03.02** -- Describe the structure of an ACMS including: inputs:
    aircraft systems (such as air conditioning, autoflight, flight controls,
    fuel, landing gear, navigation, pneumatic, APU, engine), MCDU; data
    management unit; recording unit: digital recorder; outputs: printer, ACARS
    or ATSU.
3.  **022.14.03.03.03** -- State that maintenance messages sent by an ACMS can
    be transmitted without crew notification.
4.  **022.14.03.03.04** -- Explain that data from the ACMS can be used as part
    of an FDM and safety programme.
5.  **022.14.03.03.05** -- Explain that the FDM program collects data
    anonymously; however, grave exceedance of parameters may warrant a further
    investigation of the event by the operator.
6.  **022.14.03.03.06** -- Explain the purpose of FDM as a system for
    identifying adverse safety trends and tailoring training programmes in order
    to enhance the overall safety of the operation.
