# Errors and accuracy

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.05.04.01** -- Explain that ILS approaches are divided into facility
    performance categories defined in ICAO Annex 10.
2.  **062.02.05.04.02** -- Define the following ILS operation categories:
    Category I; Category II; Category IIIA; Category IIIB; Category IIIC.
3.  **062.02.05.04.03** -- Explain that all Category III ILS operations guidance
    information is provided from the coverage limits of the facility to, and
    along, the surface of the runway.
4.  **062.02.05.04.04** -- Explain why the accuracy requirements are
    progressively higher for CAT I, CAT II and CAT III ILS.
5.  **062.02.05.04.05** -- Explain the following in accordance with ICAO Doc
    8168: the accuracy the pilot has to fly the ILS LOC to be considered
    established on an ILS track is within the half-full scale deflection of the
    required track; the aircraft has to be established within the half-scale
    deflection of the LOC before starting descent on the GP; the pilot has to
    fly the ILS GP to a maximum of half-scale fly-up deflection of the GP in
    order to stay in protected airspace.
6.  **062.02.05.04.06** -- State that if a pilot deviates by more than
    half-course deflection on the LOC or by more than half-dot deflection on the
    GP, an immediate go-around should be executed because obstacle clearance may
    no longer be guaranteed.
7.  **062.02.05.04.07** -- Describe ILS beam bends as deviations from the
    nominal LOC and GP respectively which can be assessed by flight test.
8.  **062.02.05.04.08** -- Explain that multipath interference is caused by
    reflections from objects within the ILS coverage area.
