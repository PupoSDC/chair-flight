# Safety aspects

## Learning Objectives

1.  **071.02.11.01.01** -- Explain why an aircraft may need to jettison fuel so
    as to reduce its landing mass in order to make a safe landing.
2.  **071.02.11.01.02** -- Explain that when an aircraft that operates within
    controlled airspace needs to jettison fuel, the flight crew shall coordinate
    with ATC the following: route to be flown which, if possible, should be
    clear of cities and towns, preferably over water and away from areas where
    thunderstorms have been reported or are expected; the flight level to be
    used, which should be not less than 1 800 m (6 000 ft); and the duration of
    fuel jettisoning.
3.  **071.02.11.01.03** -- Explain how flaps and slats may adversely affect fuel
    jettisoning.
