# General: Definitions and control loops

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.06.01.01.01** -- Describe the following purposes of an automatic
    flight control system (AFCS):
    - enhancement of flight controls;
    - reduction of pilot workload.
2.  **022.06.01.01.02** -- Define and explain the following two functions of an
    AFCS:
    - aircraft control: stabilise the aircraft around its centre of gravity
      (CG);
    - aircraft guidance: guidance of the aircraft"s flight path.
3.  **022.06.01.01.03** -- Describe the following two automatic control
    principles:
    - closed loop, where a feedback from an action or state is compared to the
      desired action or state;
    - open loop, where there is no feedback loop.
4.  **022.06.01.01.04** -- List the following elements of a closed-loop control
    system and explain their basic function:
    - input signal;
    - error detector;
    - signal processor providing a measured output signal according to set
      criteria or laws;
    - control element such as an actuator; feedback signal to error detector for
      comparison with input signal.
5.  **022.06.01.01.05** -- Describe how a closed-loop system may enter a state
    of self-induced oscillation if the system overcompensates for deviations
    from the desired state.
6.  **022.06.01.01.06** -- Explain how a state of self-induced oscillations may
    be detected and describe the effects of self-induced oscillations:
    - aircraft controllability;
    - aircraft safety;
    - timely manual intervention as a way of mitigating loss of control;
    - techniques that may be used to maintain positive control of the aircraft.
