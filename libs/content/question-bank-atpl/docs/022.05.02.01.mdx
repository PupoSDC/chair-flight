# Alignment process, incorrect data entry, and control panels

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.05.02.01.01** -- State that during the alignment process, the inertial
    platform is levelled (INS) or the local vertical is determined (IRS), and
    true north/aircraft heading is established.
2.  **022.05.02.01.02** -- Explain that the aircraft must be stationary during
    alignment, the aircraft position is entered during the alignment phase, and
    that the alignment process takes around 10 to 20 minutes at mid latitudes
    (longer at high latitudes).
3.  **022.05.02.01.03** -- State that in-flight realignment is not possible and
    loss of alignment leads to loss of navigational data although attitude
    information may still be available.
4.  **022.05.02.01.04** -- Explain that the inertial navigation system (INS)
    platform is maintained level and north-aligned after alignment is complete
    and the aircraft is in motion.
5.  **022.05.02.01.05** -- State that an incorrect entry of latitude may lead to
    a loss of alignment and is more critical than the incorrect entry of
    longitude.
6.  **022.05.02.01.06** -- State that the positional error of a stand-alone INS
    varies (a typical value can be quoted as 1â€“2 NM/h) and is dependent on the
    gyro drift rate, accelerometer bias, misalignment of the platform, and
    computational errors.
7.  **022.05.02.01.07** -- Explain that, on a modern aircraft, there is likely
    to be an air-data inertial reference unit (ADIRU), which is an inertial
    reference unit (IRU) integrated with an air-data computer (ADC).
8.  **022.05.02.01.08** -- Identify examples of IRS control panels.
9.  **022.05.02.01.09** -- Explain the following selections on the IRU mode
    selector: NAV (normal operation); ATT (attitude only).
10. **022.05.02.01.10** -- State that the majority of the IRS data can be
    accessed through the FMS control and display unit (CDU)/flight management
    and guidance system (FMGS) multifunction control and display unit (MCDU).
11. **022.05.02.01.11** -- Describe the procedure available to the pilot for
    assessing the performance of individual IRUs after a flight: reviewing the
    residual indicated ground speed when the aircraft has parked; reviewing the
    drift given as NM/h.
