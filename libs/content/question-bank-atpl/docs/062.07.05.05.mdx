# Required navigation performance approach (RNP APCH)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.05.05.01** -- State that pilots must not fly an RNP APCH unless it
    is retrievable by procedure name from the on-board navigation database and
    conforms to the charted procedure.
2.  **062.07.05.05.02** -- State that an RNP APCH to LNAV minima is a
    non-precision IAP designed for two-dimensional approach operations.
3.  **062.07.05.05.03** -- State that an RNP APCH to lateral navigation
    (LNAV)/vertical navigation (VNAV) minima has lateral guidance based on GNSS
    and vertical guidance based on either SBAS or barometric vertical navigation
    (Baro-VNAV).
4.  **062.07.05.05.04** -- State that an RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima may only
    be conducted with vertical guidance certified for the purpose.
5.  **062.07.05.05.05** -- Explain why an RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima based on
    Baro-VNAV may only be conducted when the aerodrome temperature is within a
    promulgated range if the barometric input is not automatically
    temperature-compensated.
6.  **062.07.05.05.06** -- State that the correct altimeter setting is critical
    for the safe conduct of an RNP APCH using Baro-VNAV.
7.  **062.07.05.05.070** -- State that an RNP APCH to LNAV/VNAV minima is a
    three-dimensional operation.
8.  **062.07.05.05.08** -- State that an RNP APCH to localiser performance with
    vertical guidance (LPV) minima is a three-dimensional operation.
9.  **062.07.05.05.09** -- State that RNP APCH to LPV minima requires a final
    approach segment (FAS) data block.
10. **062.07.05.05.10** -- State that RNP approaches to LPV minima require SBAS.
11. **062.07.05.05.11** -- State that the FAS data block is a standard data
    format to describe the final approach path.
