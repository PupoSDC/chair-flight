# Errors and accuracy

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.02.04.01** -- Explain "coastal refraction": as a radio wave
    travelling over land crosses the coast, the wave speeds up over water and
    the wave front bends.
2.  **062.02.02.04.02** -- Define "night/twilight effect": the influence of sky
    waves and ground waves arriving at the ADF receiver with a difference of
    phase and polarisation which introduce bearing errors.
3.  **062.02.02.04.03** -- State that interference from other NDB stations on
    the same frequency may occur at night due to sky-wave contamination.
