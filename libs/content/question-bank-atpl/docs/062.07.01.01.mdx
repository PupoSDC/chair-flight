# PBN principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.01.01.01** -- List the factors used to define area navigation
    (RNAV) or required navigation performance (RNP) system performance
    requirements (accuracy, integrity and continuity).
2.  **062.07.01.01.02** -- State that these RNAV and RNP systems are necessary
    to optimise the utilisation of available airspace.
3.  **062.07.01.01.03** -- State that it is necessary for flight crew and air
    traffic controllers to be aware of the on-board RNAV or RNP system
    capabilities in order to determine whether the performance of the RNAV or
    RNP system is appropriate for the specific airspace requirements.
4.  **062.07.01.01.04** -- Define accuracy as the conformance of the true
    position and the required position.
5.  **062.07.01.01.05** -- Define continuity as the capability of the system to
    perform its function without unscheduled interruptions during the intended
    operation.
6.  **062.07.01.01.06** -- Define integrity as a measure of the trust that can
    be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the total
    system. Integrity includes the ability of a system to provide timely and
    valid alerts to the user.
7.  **062.07.01.01.07** -- State that, unlike conventional navigation, PBN is
    not sensor-specific.
8.  **062.07.01.01.08** -- Explain the difference between raw data and computed
    data.
9.  **062.07.01.01.09** -- Define availability as the percentage of time
    (annually) during which the system is available for use.
