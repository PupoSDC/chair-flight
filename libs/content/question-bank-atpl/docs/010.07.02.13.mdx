# Separation in the vicinity of aerodromes (ADs)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **010.07.02.13.01** -- Describe the expression "essential local traffic".
2.  **010.07.02.13.02** -- State which possible decision the PIC may choose to
    take if they are asked to accept take-off in a direction which is not "into
    the wind".
3.  **010.07.02.13.03** -- State the condition to enable ATC to initiate a
    visual approach for an IFR flight.
4.  **010.07.02.13.04** -- State whether or not separation shall be provided by
    ATC between an aircraft executing a visual approach and other arriving or
    departing aircraft.
5.  **010.07.02.13.05** -- State in which case, when the flight crew are not
    familiar with the instrument approach procedure being carried out, only the
    final approach track has to be given to them by ATC.
6.  **010.07.02.13.06** -- Describe which FL should be assigned to an aircraft
    first arriving over a holding fix for landing.
7.  **010.07.02.13.07** -- State which kinds of priority can be applied to
    aircraft for a landing.
8.  **010.07.02.13.08** -- Describe the situation when a pilot of an aircraft in
    an approach sequence indicates their intention to hold for weather
    improvements.
9.  **010.07.02.13.09** -- Explain the term "expected approach time" and the
    procedures for its use.
10. **010.07.02.13.10** -- State the reasons which could probably lead to the
    decision to use another take-off or landing direction than the one into the
    wind.
11. **010.07.02.13.11** -- State the possible consequences for a PIC if the
    "RWY-in-use" is not considered suitable for the operation involved.
