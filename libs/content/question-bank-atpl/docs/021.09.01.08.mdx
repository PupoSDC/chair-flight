# Semiconductors and logic circuits

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.09.01.08.01** -- Describe the effect of temperature on semiconductors
    with regard to function and longevity of the component.
2.  **021.09.01.08.02** -- Describe the following five basic logic functions, as
    used in aircraft FCOM documentation, and recognise their schematic symbols
    according to the ANSI/MIL standard: AND; OR; NOT; NOR; NAND.
3.  **021.09.01.08.03** -- Interpret a typical logic circuit schematic to the
    level of detail as found in an aircraft FCOM.
