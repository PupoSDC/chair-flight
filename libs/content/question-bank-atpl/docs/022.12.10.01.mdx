# Principles and operations

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.12.10.01.01** -- State that ACAS II is an ICAO standard for
    anti-collision purposes.
2.  **022.12.10.01.02** -- Explain that ACAS II is an anti-collision system and
    does not guarantee any specific separation.
3.  **022.12.10.01.03** -- Describe the purpose of an ACAS II system as an
    anti-collision system.
4.  **022.12.10.01.04** -- Describe the following outputs from a TCAS: other
    intruders; proximate intruders; traffic advisory (TA); resolution advisory
    (RA).
5.  **022.12.10.01.05** -- State that ACAS II will issue commands in the
    vertical plane only (climb, descent or maintain), and that the commands are
    complied with as a manual manoeuvre.
6.  **022.12.10.01.06** -- Explain that an RA may or may not require any active
    control input and the implications of reacting instinctively without
    awareness of actual control inputs required to comply with the RA.
7.  **022.12.10.01.07** -- Explain that if two aircraft are fitted with ACAS II,
    the RA will be coordinated.
8.  **022.12.10.01.08** -- State that ACAS II equipment can take into account
    several threats simultaneously.
9.  **022.12.10.01.09** -- State that a detected aircraft without
    altitude-reporting can only generate a TA; describe typical type of traffic
    and how this can create distractions during flight in certain areas of
    significant air traffic activity.
10. **022.12.10.01.10** -- Describe the interaction between the TCAS II system
    and the transponder, radio altimeter and the air-data computer: antenna
    used; computer and links with radio altimeter, air-data computer and mode-S
    transponder.
11. **022.12.10.01.11** -- Explain the principle of TCAS II interrogations.
12. **022.12.10.01.12** -- State the typical standard detection range for TCAS
    II: 35â€“40 NM horizontally; approximately 2 000 ft above and below (any
    setting); extension to approximately 10 000 ft above (ABV selected) or
    approximately 10 000 ft below (BLW selected).
13. **022.12.10.01.13** -- Explain the principle of "reduced surveillance".
14. **022.12.10.01.14** -- Explain that in high-density traffic areas the range
    may automatically be decreased in order to enable detection of the threats
    in the proximity of the aircraft due to a limitation of the maximum number
    of possible intruders the system is able to process.
15. **022.12.10.01.15** -- Identify the equipment which an intruder must be
    fitted with in order to be detected by TCAS II.
16. **022.12.10.01.16** -- Explain in the anti-collision process: the criteria
    used to trigger an alarm (TA or RA) are the time to reach the closest point
    of approach (CPA) (called TAU) and the difference of altitude; an intruder
    will be classified as "proximate" when being less than 6 NM and 1 200 ft
    from the TCAS-equipped aircraft; the time limit to CPA is different
    depending on aircraft altitude, is linked to a sensitivity level (SL), and
    state that the value to trigger an RA is from 15 to 35 seconds; in case of
    an RA, the intended vertical separation varies from 300 to 600 ft (700 ft
    above FL420., depending on the SL; below 1 000 ft above ground, no RA can be
    generated; below 1 450 ft (radio-altimeter value) "increase descent" RA is
    inhibited; at high altitude, performances of the type of aircraft are taken
    into account to inhibit "climb" and "increase climb" RA.
17. **022.12.10.01.17** -- List and interpret the following information
    available from TCAS: the different possible statuses of a detected aircraft:
    - "other",
    - "proximate",
    - "intruder";
    - the appropriate graphic symbols and their position on the horizontal
      display;
    - different aural warnings.
18. **022.12.10.01.18** -- Explain the indications of a TA and an RA and how an
    RA will generate a red area on the VSI. Some variants will also include a
    green area. To manoeuvre the aircraft to comply with the RA, the pilot
    should "avoid the red" or "fly the green".
19. **022.12.10.01.19** -- Explain that the pilot must not interpret the
    horizontal track of an intruder upon the display.
