# Loads, stresses and aeroelastic vibrations

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.02.05.03.01** -- Describe the dangers and stresses regarding safety
    and serviceability in flight when the manufacturer"s design envelope is
    exceeded.
2.  **021.02.05.03.02** -- Explain that blade tracking is important both to
    minimise vibration and to help ensure uniformity of flow through the disc.
3.  **021.02.05.03.03** -- Describe the early indications and vibrations which
    are likely to be experienced when the main-rotor blades and tail rotor are
    out of balance or tracking, including the possible early indications due to
    possible fatigue and overload.
4.  **021.02.05.03.04** -- Explain how a vibration harmonic can be set up in
    other components which can lead to their early failure.
5.  **021.02.05.03.05** -- State the three planes of vibration measurement, i.e.
    vertical, lateral, fore and aft.
