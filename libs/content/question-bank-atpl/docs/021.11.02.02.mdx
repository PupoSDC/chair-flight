## Summary

### Compressor stall and Surge

Compressor blades are aerofoils, and if a too high angle of attack exists
between the blade and the incoming airflow a stall will occur. When such a stall
occurs over one blade, or a limited number of blades we are in the presence of a
_Compressor Stall_.

Compressor stalls always begins at the first stages of a compressor and travel
deeper and deeper into to the turbine as they develop. If the entire compressor
is stalled, we are in the presence of a _Compressor Surge_. When a compressor
surge develops, Velocity decreases inside the compressor and conversely static
pressure rapidly increases. This will eventually lead to a flow reversal which
in turn will _choke_ the combustion chambers and lead to a flame-out.

Compressor stall and surge are more common when the engine is at low RPMs

</Option>

  <Explanation>
    Two things to keep in mind:

    *   Compressor stall develops in the most forward stages of the compressor (low pressure stages first).
    *   Compressor stall can be avoided / mitigated, by allowing the air to flow away from the back of the compressor.

    For this reason a bypass valve can be installed between the low pressure and high pressure compressors, allowing air
    that would otherwise flow into the HP compressor to flow outside the engine. This allows the pressure in the LP compressor
    to drop, which in turn allows the air to flow more "easily" through the LP compressor reducing the risk of stall.
