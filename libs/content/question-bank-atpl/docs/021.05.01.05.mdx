# System components, design, operation, indications and warnings, degraded modes of operation, jamming

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.05.01.05.01** -- List and describe the function of the following
    components of a flight control system:
    - actuators;
    - control valves;
    - cables;
    - electrical wiring;
    - control surface position sensors.
2.  **021.05.01.05.02** -- Explain how redundancy is obtained in primary flight
    control systems of large transport aeroplanes.
3.  **021.05.01.05.03** -- Explain the danger of control jamming and the means
    of retaining sufficient control capability.
4.  **021.05.01.05.04** -- Explain the methods of locking the controls on the
    ground and describe "gust or control lock" warnings.
5.  **021.05.01.05.05** -- Explain the concept of a rudder deflection limitation
    (rudder limiter) system and the various means of implementation (rudder
    ratio changer, variable stops, blow-back).
