# Principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.03.03.01.01** -- List the two main tasks of the weather radar in
    respect of weather and navigation.
2.  **062.03.03.01.02** -- State that modern weather radars employ frequencies
    that give wavelengths of about 3 cm that reflect best on wet hailstones.
3.  **062.03.03.01.03** -- State that the antenna is stabilised in the
    horizontal plane with signals from the aircraft"s attitude reference system.
4.  **062.03.03.01.04** -- Describe the cone-shaped pencil beam of about 3 to 5
    degrees beam width used for weather detection.
