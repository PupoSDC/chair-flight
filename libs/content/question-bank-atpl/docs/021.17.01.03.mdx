# Forces and stresses

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.17.01.03.01** -- Describe main-rotor blade-loading on the ground and
    in flight.
2.  **021.17.01.03.02** -- Describe where the most common stress areas are on
    rotor blades.
3.  **021.17.01.03.03** -- Show how the centrifugal forces depend on rotor rpm
    and blade mass and how they pull on the blade"s attachment to the hub.
    Justify the upper limit of the rotor rpm.
4.  **021.17.01.03.04** -- Assume a rigid attachment and show how thrust may
    cause huge oscillating bending moments which stress the attachment.
5.  **021.17.01.03.05** -- Explain why flapping hinges do not transfer such
    moments. Show the small flapping hinge offset on fully articulated rotors
    and zero offset in the case of teetering rotors.
6.  **021.17.01.03.06** -- Describe the working principle of the flexible
    element in the hingeless rotor and describe the equivalent flapping hinge
    offset compared to that of the articulated rotor.
