<Option correct>
  They are used for passengers who, for physiological reasons, might require
  oxygen following a cabin depressurization.
</Option>
<Option>They are used if an onboard fire needs to be extinguished</Option>
<Option>They are used by crew in order to prevent fatigue</Option>

  <Option>
    They are only to be used in case of a sudden loss in aeroplane
    pressurization, for pressurized aeroplanes operated at pressure altitudes of
    10000 ft and above

    Which of these statements concerning oxygen on board of passenger transport
    aeroplanes is correct?
  </Text>
<Option correct>
  Portable oxygen bottles in the cabin are primarily intended for first aid
  purposes.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  After being activated a chemical oxygen generator produces heat.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  Chemical oxygen generators are provided with an heat shield.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  Lavatories must be fitted with a fixed oxygen system that is activated at the
  same time as the cabin system.
</Option>
<Option why="lavatories must be equipped with an oxygen system as any other cabin location">
  Since lavatories are not fitted with an oxygen system, they should be
  evacuated quickly in case of decompression.
</Option>
<Option why="chemical generators heat up when activated">
  After being activated a chemical oxygen generator does not produce any heat.
</Option>
<Option why="chemical generators typically have a lifespan of less than 15 mins as they are intended to supply oxygen only during enough time to allow the aircraft to descend below 10.000ft">
  A chemical oxygen generator is able to provide oxygen for at least one hour.
</Option>

  <Option why="their primary use is for first aid purposes.">
    Portable oxygen bottles are primarily intended for use in case the chemical
    oxygen generators fail.

<Option
  correct

  these substances can catch fire spontaneously in the presence of oxygen.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  the interaction of oil and and oxygen creates a fire hazard.
</Option>
<Option>these substances could block the oxygen mask filters.</Option>
<Option>
  The interaction of oil-based products and oxygen creates a non-flammable
  smoke, which reduces visibility.
</Option>
<Option>the breathing oxygen could be contaminated by these substances.</Option>
<Option>
  Oxygen absorbs oil and grease particles, causing the oxygen to become toxic.
</Option>
<Option why="Although correct, maintaining good oil lubrication properties is not even close to a priority in an oxygen system.">
  The interaction of oxygen and oil-based products reduces the lubricating
  capacity of those products.
