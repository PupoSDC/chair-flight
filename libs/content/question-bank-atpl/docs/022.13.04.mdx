# Engine parameters, crew warnings, aircraft systems, procedure and mission display systems

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.13.04.01.01** -- State the purpose of the following systems:
    - engine instruments centralised display unit;
    - crew alerting system/aircraft display unit;
    - facility for appropriate on-screen checklists;
    - that the aircraft systems display unit enables the display of normal and
      degraded modes of operation of the aircraft systems;
    - that the systems/aircraft display unit is able to show pictorial systems
      diagrams/schematics and associated parameters.
2.  **022.13.04.01.02** -- Describe the similarities to EFIS with regard to
    basic system architecture.
3.  **022.13.04.01.03** -- Give the following different names by which engine
    parameters, crew warnings, aircraft systems and procedures display systems
    are known:
    - multifunction display unit (MFDU);
    - engine indication and crew alerting systems (EICASs);
    - engine and warning display (EWD);
    - electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM);
    - systems display (S/D).
4.  **022.13.04.01.04** -- Give the names of the following different display
    systems and describe their main functions:
    - vehicle engine monitoring display (VEMD);
    - integrated instruments display system (IIDS).
5.  **022.13.04.01.05** -- State the purpose of a mission display unit.
6.  **022.13.04.01.06** -- Describe the architecture of each system and give
    examples of display.
7.  **022.13.04.01.07** -- Explain why awareness of the consequences of the
    actions commanded by the automatic checklist is required.
8.  **022.13.04.01.08** -- Explain the limited ability of the computer to assess
    a situation other than using the exceedance of certain thresholds to trigger
    the main and subsequent events and programmed actions.
9.  **022.13.04.01.09** -- Describe an appropriate procedure for following an
    on-screen checklist associated with a failure scenario including the
    following:
    - confirm the failure with the other flight crew member prior to performing
      any of the actions;
    - seek confirmation prior to manipulating any guarded switches or thrust
      levers;
    - follow the checklist slowly and methodically;
    - assess the possible implications of making certain selections, such as
      opening the fuel cross-feed if there is a fuel leak even though the
      electronic checklist may ask ffor the action.
