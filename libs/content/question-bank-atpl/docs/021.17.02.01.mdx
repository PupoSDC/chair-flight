# Design, construction

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.17.02.01.01** -- Describe the most common design of tail-rotor blade
    construction, consisting of stainless steel shell reinforced by a honeycomb
    filler and stainless steel leading abrasive strip.
2.  **021.17.02.01.02** -- Explain that ballast weights are located at the
    inboard trailing edge and tip of blades, and that the weights used are
    determined when the blades are manufactured.
3.  **021.17.02.01.03** -- Describe how, for some helicopters,
    anti-icing/de-icing systems are designed into the blade construction.
4.  **021.17.02.01.04** -- Describe the two-bladed rotor with a teetering hinge,
    and rotors with more than two blades.
5.  **021.17.02.01.05** -- Describe the dangers to ground personnel and to the
