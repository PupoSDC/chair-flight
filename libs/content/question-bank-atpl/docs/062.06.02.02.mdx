# Satellite-based augmentation systems (SBASs)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.06.02.02.01** -- Explain the principle of an SBAS: to measure on the
    ground the errors in the signals received from the satellites and transmit
    differential corrections and integrity messages for navigation satellites.
2.  **062.06.02.02.02** -- State that the frequency band of the data link is
    identical to that of the GPS signals.
3.  **062.06.02.02.03** -- Explain that the use of geostationary satellites
    enables messages to be broadcast over very wide areas.
4.  **062.06.02.02.04** -- State that pseudo-range measurements to these
    geostationary satellites can also be made, as if they were GPS satellites.
5.  **062.06.02.02.05** -- State that SBAS consists of two elements: ground
    infrastructure (monitoring and processing stations); communication
    satellites.
6.  **062.06.02.02.06** -- State that SBAS allows the implementation of
    three-dimensional Type A and Type B approaches.
7.  **062.06.02.02.07** -- State the following examples of SBAS:
    - European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in western
      Europe and the Mediterranean;
    - wide area augmentation system (WAAS) in the USA;
    - multi-functional transport satellite (MTSAT)-based augmentation system
      (MSAS) in Japan;
    - GPS and geostationary earth orbit augmented navigation (GAGAN) in India.
8.  **062.06.02.02.08** -- State that SBAS is designed to significantly improve
    accuracy and integrity.
9.  **062.06.02.02.09** -- Explain that integrity and safety are improved by
    alerting SBAS users within 6 seconds if a GPS malfunction occurs.
