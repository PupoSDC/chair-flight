### Impulse and Reaction turbines

The idea behind a turbine is to extract energy from the incoming flow to convert
it into rotation of a turbine wheel. In principle, there are two ways to achieve
this.

#### Impulse turbine

In an impulse turbine, the basic idea is to have the incoming jet of air strike
the rotor blades, causing them to move. This process extracts kinetic energy
from the incoming airflow and as such results in a velocity drop of the flow in
the rotor. Pressure on the other hand, remains constant in this process.

The guiding vanes in an impulse turbine are used to optimize flow direction so
as to strike the rotor blades at the optimal position. They are also used to
accelerate the flow by converting potential energy into kinetic energy,
resulting in a pressure decrease, and a velocity increase.

#### Reaction turbine

In a reaction turbine, the disk is rotated as a consequence of the aerodynamic
action of the air passing through the rotor blades. Rotor blades are shaped like
aerofoils and function very much like one. As the flow develops around an
aerofoil. flow velocity as a tendency to increase and pressure decreases.
Furthermore, there is usually slight convergence of the rotor blades duct,
further promoting the increase in speed and a decrease in velocity.

The function of Nozzle guide vanes in a reaction turbine are subject of much
debate. Primary sources, contradict each other.

According to [Rolls Royce - The Jet Engine; Chapter 5]():

> In the reaction type the fixed nozzle guide vanes are designed to alter the
> gas flow direction without changing the pressure.

But according to
[Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbookâ€“ Powerplant, Volume 1]()

> the nozzle converts a varying portion of the heat and pressure energy to
> velocity energy that can then be converted to mechanical energy through the
> turbine blades.

EASA considers the second source as correct. For both impulse and reaction
turbines the same effect from a nozzle guide canes is to be expected; As no
energy is absorbed, we observe a pure exchange of kinetic and potential energy.
Total Energy remains constant, but pressure decreases and velocity increases.

#### In summary

- P - Flow static Pressure
- T - Flow static Temperature
- V - Flow velocity
- E - Flow total energy - Kinetic Energy (from its velocity) + Potential Energy
  (from its pressure)

|                     | Impulse Turbine | Reaction Turbine |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| P/T at Stator Vanes | Decreases       | Decreases        |
| V at Stator Vanes   | Increases       | Increases        |
| E at Stator Vanes   | Constant        | Constant         |
|                     |                 |                  |
| P/T at Rotor blades | Constant        | Decreases        |
| V at Rotor blades   | Decreases       | Decreases        |
| E at Rotor blades   | Decreases       | Decreases        |

**Remember**:

- Pressure and Temperature both represent potential energy of the flow and as
  such follow the same pattern.
- Total energy remains constant In stator stages, and decreases in rotor stages
  as energy is absorbed.
- In stator stages the flows is redirected and/or constricted resulting in an
  exchange of potential for kinetic energy
- In rotor stages energy is absorbed resulting in a net less of kinetic +
  potential energy.
- In an impulse type turbine, at the rotor only kinetic energy is absorbed.
  Pressure remains constant and velocity decreases.
- In an reaction type turbine, at the rotor both kinetic and potential energy
  are absorbed. Both Pressure and Velocity decrease.
