### Magneto-ignition system

Aircraft piston engines are typically installed with an independent system to
provide the electrical energy required to create a spark within a combustion
chamber.

This system, known as a magneto-ignition system, use a rotating permanent magnet
as it's main source of power. This rotating magnet is connected to the engine
camshaft
