> **Flash Point - `3838-20`** > **freezing Point `404760`**

#### Additives for freezing

Fuel system icing inhibitors are additives added to jet fuel to reduce the
freezing point and prevent ice crystal formation.

#### Baffles and Baffle valves

- Baffles - Dampen the fuel movement
- Baffle valves - PRevent outward movement of flow (from the wing root to the
  tip)

#### Dip sticks

The quantity of fuel is determined by using measurements from the dip stick and
data tables in the aircraft documentation.
