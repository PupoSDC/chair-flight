# Gridded forecast products

## Learning Objectives

1.  **050.10.02.04.01** -- State that numerical weather prediction uses a 3D
    grid of weather data, consisting of horizontal data (latitude-longitude) and
    vertical data (height or pressure).
2.  **050.10.02.04.02** -- Explain that world area forecast centres prepare
    global sets of gridded forecasts for flight planning purposes (upper wind,
    temperature, humidity).
3.  **050.10.02.04.03** -- State that the WAFCs also produce gridded datasets
    for Flight Level and temperature of the tropopause, direction and speed of
    maximum wind, cumulonimbus clouds, icing and turbulence.
4.  **050.10.02.04.04** -- Explain that the data on CB and turbulence can be
    used in the visualization of flight hazards.
5.  **050.10.02.04.05** -- Explain that the gridded forecasts can be merged in
    information processing systems with data relayed from aircraft or pilot
    reports, e.g. of turbulence, to provide improved situation awareness.
