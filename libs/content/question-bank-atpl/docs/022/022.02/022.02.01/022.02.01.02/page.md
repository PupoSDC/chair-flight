      ["static source of an altimeter becomes blocked during a climb"],
    ]}
  >
    continue to display the reading at which the blockage occurred
  </Option>

  <Explanation>
    The altimeter's only input source is static pressure. If this becomes
    blocked, the instrument will simply 'freeze', indicating the altitude at
    which the blockage occurred. The Airspeed indicator has 2 inputs: The pitot
    tube and the static port. Velocity is computed from the difference between
    the total pressure and the static pressure. The higher the difference, the
    higher the speed. When the static port becomes blocked, the base value for
    this comparison stagnates. In case of a climb, the outside air pressure will
    be decreasing, while our instrument will be measuring a value that is higher
    than the real value. The total pressure pressure will also be decreasing,
    meaning that our instrument will begin to under read the velocity. The
    opposite is true during a descent where the static port will be
    under-reading the static pressure, but the dynamic pressure will keep
    increasing, leading to an over-read of the velocity.
