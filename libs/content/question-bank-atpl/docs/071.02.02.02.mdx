# Procedure to apply in case of performance deterioration, on ground/in flight

## Learning Objectives

1.  **071.02.02.02.01** -- Explain that the effects of icing are wide-ranging,
    unpredictable and dependent upon individual aircraft design. The magnitude
    of these effects is dependent upon many variables, but the effects can be
    both significant and dangerous.
2.  **071.02.02.02.02** -- Explain that in icing conditions, for a given speed
    and a given angle of attack, wing lift can be reduced by as much as 30 % and
    drag increased by up to 40 %. State that these changes in lift and drag will
    significantly increase stall speed, reduce controllability, and alter flight
    characteristics.
3.  **071.02.02.02.03** -- Explain that ice on critical surfaces and on the
    airframe may also break away during take-off and be ingested into engines,
    possibly damaging fan and compressor blades.
4.  **071.02.02.02.04** -- Explain that ice forming on pitot tubes and static
    ports or on angle-of-attack vanes may give false altitude, airspeed,
    angle-of-attack and engine-power information for air-data systems.
5.  **071.02.02.02.05** -- Explain that ice, frost and snow formed on the
    critical surfaces on the ground can have a totally different effect on
    aircraft flight characteristics than ice, frost and snow formed in flight.
6.  **071.02.02.02.06** -- Explain that flight in known icing conditions is
    subject to limitations that are contained in Part B of the operations
    manual.
7.  **071.02.02.02.07** -- Explain where procedures and performances regarding
    flight in expected or actual icing conditions can be found.
