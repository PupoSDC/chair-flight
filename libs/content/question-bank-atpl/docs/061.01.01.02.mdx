# Earth rotation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **061.01.01.02.01** -- Describe the rotation of the Earth around its own
    spin axis and the plane of the ecliptic (including the relationship of the
    spin axis to the plane of the ecliptic).
2.  **061.01.01.02.02** -- Explain the effect that the inclination of the
    Earth"s spin axis has on insolation and duration of daylight.

## Summary

The Artic circle is at 66 degrees 33 minutes North. Higher than this latitude
during the Winter months the Sun will not be seen and a state of continuous
night or twilight exists.

If The Sun is at a celestial latitude of 90 degrees then it is directly over the
subject's head.\
This can occur only within the tropical band of latitude between 23 degrees 27 minutes
North and 23 degrees 27 minutes South

<Option>66.5º</Option>
<Option correct>23.5º</Option>

  <Explanation>
    The ecliptic is the annual path of the apparent Sun around the celestial sphere.

    The Earth's vertical axis is tilted by 23 degrees 27 minutes from the vertical.

    A line drawn from the Sun will differ from the plane of the Earth's equator by
    23 degrees 27 minutes.
