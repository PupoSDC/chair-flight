# Versions, applications, CPDLC messages, ADS contracts

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.10.02.01.01** -- Describe the existence of the ICAO communication,
    navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) concept.
2.  **022.10.02.01.02** -- Explain the two versions of FANSs:

- FANS A/FANS 1 using the ACARS network;
- FANS B/FANS 2 using the ACARS network and the aeronautical telecommunication
  network (ATN).

3.  **022.10.02.01.03** -- List and explain the following FANS A/FANS 1
    applications:

- ATS facility notification (AFN);
- automatic dependent surveillance (ADS);
- CPDLC.

4.  **022.10.02.01.04** -- Compare the ADS application with the secondary
    surveillance radar function, and the CPDLC application with VHF
    communication systems.
5.  **022.10.02.01.05** -- State that an ATCU can use the ADS application only,
    or the CPDLC application only, or both of them (not including AFN).
6.  **022.10.02.01.06** -- Describe the AFN process for logging on with an ATCU
    and typical data that will be included in the message.
7.  **022.10.02.01.07** -- Describe typical types of CPDLC messages and the
    typical pilot work practices when requesting or accepting a CPDLC clearance.
8.  **022.10.02.01.08** -- List and describe the different types of ADS
    contracts that are controlled by the ATCU and beyond the control of the
    pilot: periodic: data sent at set time intervals; on demand: data sent when
    requested; on event: data sent when an event occurs (e.g. heading change,
    climb initiated, etc.); emergency mode.
9.  **022.10.02.01.09** -- Describe the purpose of the ADS emergency mode
    contract and highlight the difference to the ATCU controlled contracts.

## Summary

### ATS facility notification (AFN);

### automatic dependent surveillance (ADS);

### CPDLC.

Controller Pilot Data Link Communication contains the stack of predefined
messages and formats on the (M)CDU that allow the pilot to communicate with ATC.
Clearances and messages are exchanged via the CPDLC standards and protocols
