    convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.
2.  **021.09.05.01.02** -- State that because of the similarity in design, a
    generator and an electrical motor may be combined into a starter generator.
3.  **021.09.05.01.03** -- Explain that the size of the engine determines how
    much energy is required for starting, and state the following: small turbine
    engines may be able to use the battery for a very limited number of start
    attempts; large turbine engines require one or more power sources, either
    external or on-board.
