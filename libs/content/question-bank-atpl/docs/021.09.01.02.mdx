# Direct current (DC)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.09.01.02.01** -- Explain the term "direct current" (DC), and state
    that current can only flow in a closed circuit.
2.  **021.09.01.02.02** -- Explain the basic principles of conductivity and give
    examples of conductors, semiconductors and insulators.
3.  **021.09.01.02.03** -- Describe the difference in use of the following
    mechanical switches and explain the difference in observing their state
    (e.g. ON/OFF), and why some switches are guarded: toggle switch; rocker
    switch; pushbutton switch; rotary switch. Explain the difference in
    observing their state (e.g. ON/OFF) and why some switches are guarded.
4.  **021.09.01.02.04** -- Define voltage and current, and state their unit of
    measurement.
5.  **021.09.01.02.05** -- Explain Ohm's law in qualitative terms.
6.  **021.09.01.02.06** -- Explain the effect on total resistance when resistors
    are connected in series or in parallel.
7.  **021.09.01.02.07** -- State that resistances can have a positive or a
    negative temperature coefficient (PTC/NTC) and state their use.
8.  **021.09.01.02.08** -- Define electrical power and state the unit of
    measurement.
