# Repositioning of CG by shifting the load

## Learning Objectives

1.  **031.05.03.01.01** -- Calculate the mass to be moved over a given distance,
    or to/from given compartments, to establish a defined CG position.
2.  **031.05.03.01.02** -- Calculate the distance to move a given mass to
    establish a defined CG position.
3.  **031.05.03.01.03** -- Describe the methods to check that cargo has been
    loaded in correct position in relation to the loading manifest, including
    identifying hazard of cargo loaded in reverse order (visual inspection of
    one or more unit load devices (ULDs).
4.  **031.05.03.01.04** -- Determine whether CG remains within limits if cargo
    has been loaded in incorrect order or at incorrect location.
