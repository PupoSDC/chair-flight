# Reverse thrust

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.11.03.07.01** -- Name the following main components of a
    reverse-thrust system and state their function: reverse-thrust select lever;
    power source (pneumatic or hydraulic); actuators; doors; annunciations.
2.  **021.11.03.07.02** -- Explain the principle of a reverse-thrust system.
3.  **021.11.03.07.03** -- Identify the advantages and disadvantages of using
    reverse thrust.
4.  **021.11.03.07.04** -- Describe and explain the following different types of
    thrust-reverser systems: hot-stream reverser; clamshell or bucket-door
    system; cold-stream reverser (only turbofan engines); blocker doors; cascade
    vanes.
5.  **021.11.03.07.05** -- Explain the implications of reversing the cold stream
    (fan reverser) only on a high bypass ratio engine.
6.  **021.11.03.07.06** -- Describe the protection features against inadvertent
    thrust-reverse deployment in flight as present on most transport aeroplanes.
7.  **021.11.03.07.07** -- Describe the controls and indications provided for
    the thrust-reverser system.

## Summary

### Trust reverser controls and indications

The thrust reverser is operated with a lever that is embedded in the main
throttle quadrant:

![Thrust reverser lever](images/021.11.03.07-01.jpeg)

The **stowed** position is the default position. In this position the thrust
reveres are stowed away, i.e.: they are not deployed. To operate the controls
the throttle must be in idle to allow the lever to be moved. The lever can then
be pulled up to the desired thrust reverser intensity.

A reverse thrust alert light is provided that turns on under abnormal situations
such as:

- The **reverse doors are unlocked** with the **reverser lever in the stowed**
  position.
- The **reverser doors remain stowed** with the **reverser lever in the
  deployed** position.

  <Option why="At full throttle the reverser doors should definitely be closed. So all is good.  No warning light required.">
    The reverser doors remain stowed with full throttle.
