# Average airspeed

## Learning Objectives

1.  **061.01.08.01.01** -- Average TAS used for climb problems is calculated at
    the altitude 2/3 of the cruising altitude.
2.  **061.01.08.01.02** -- Average TAS used for descent problems is calculated
    at the altitude 1/2 of the descent altitude.

## Summary

<Question id="BADN4IFFD7" id="AafsJkc" variant="definition" lo={['061.01.08.01.01', '061.01.08.01.02']}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">The average wind direction and velocity used for <Subject /> problems is...</Text>
  <Option id="AafsJkc-1" subject={[['descent']]}>1/2 of the <Subject /> altitude</Option>
  <Option id="AafsJkc-2" subject={[['climb']]}>2/3 of the <Subject /> altitude</Option>
  <Option id="AafsJkc-3">1/3 of the <Subject /> altitude</Option>
  <Option id="AafsJkc-4">No such approximation should be used as it would be too inacurate</Option>

  <Explanation>
    Long story short, there is no 100% correct way of doing this. It' just a "rule of thumb"
    approximation you can use for doing quick arethemetics inside a cockpit. These values are just
    pulled straight from EASA Learning Objectives and you should memorize them:

    *   Average TAS used for climb problems is calculated at the altitude 2/3 of the
        cruising altitude.
    *   Average TAS used for descent problems is calculated at the altitude 1/2 of the
        descent altitude.

    This makes some sense as a descent will usually be performed at a constant
    descent rate throughout, making the middle point a decent average of the wind
    speed and direction. During a climb however, you can assume a climb rate
    decrease towards the end of the climb, biassing the "average" point towards a
    higher altitude. As such a higher factor of 2/3 is used.
