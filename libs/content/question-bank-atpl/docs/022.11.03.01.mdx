# Data, calculations, position inputs, raw data

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.11.03.01.01** -- Describe typical data that may be provided by the
    FMS: lateral and vertical navigation guidance; present position; time
    predictions; fuel predictions; altitude/flight level predictions.
2.  **022.11.03.01.02** -- Explain how the FMS will use a combination of
    inputted/database and measured data in order to calculate projections and
    provide output data.
3.  **022.11.03.01.03** -- Explain the issues and threats using
    inputted/database data and give examples of consequences of inputting data
    incorrectly/using incorrect data.
4.  **022.11.03.01.04** -- Describe fuel consumption calculations during
    standard operations and explain typical data that will have an influence on
    the accuracy of the calculations.
5.  **022.11.03.01.05** -- Explain the implications on the accuracy of the
    calculations during flight in abnormal configurations (such as engine out,
    gear down, flaps extended, spoilers extended, etc.) if the FMS is unable to
    detect the failure.
6.  **022.11.03.01.06** -- Describe and explain the purpose of an FMS having
    dedicated radio-navigation receivers that it will tune automatically.
7.  **022.11.03.01.07** -- Explain typical position inputs to an FMS: GPS; IRS;
    DME; VOR; LOC; runway threshold (RWY THR).
8.  **022.11.03.01.08** -- Explain how the FMS will create its own FMS position
    fix and that the FMS calculations will be based on the FMS position.
    Depending on the type of system, the FMS position may be calculated from: a
    single source of position data where the most accurate data available at a
    given time will be used; multiple sources from which a position will be
    derived using the combined inputs.
9.  **022.11.03.01.09** -- Explain the implications of a reduction in available
    position inputs to the FMS, especially GPS in relation to the capability of
    performing RNP/PBN approaches.
10. **022.11.03.01.10** -- Explain the difference between following the FMS data
    compared to following raw data from radio-navigation receivers and describe
    how there may be limitations for using FMS data as primary source to follow
    an instrument approach procedure (IAP) such as LOC, VOR or NDB.
