# Flight director: design and operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.06.03.01.01** -- Explain the purpose of a flight director system.
2.  **022.06.03.01.02** -- Describe the different types of display: pitch and
    roll crossbars; V-bar.
3.  **022.06.03.01.03** -- Explain the differences between a flight director and
    an autopilot and how the flight director provides a means of cross-checking
    the control/guidance commands sent to the autopilot.
4.  **022.06.03.01.04** -- Explain why the flight director must be followed when
    engaged/shown, and describe the appropriate use of the flight director:
    - flight director only;
    - autopilot only;
    - flight director and autopilot;
    - typical job-share between pilots (pilot flying (PF)/pilot monitoring (PM))
      for selecting the parameters when autopilot is engaged versus disengaged;
    - highlight when the flight director should not be followed or should be
      disengaged.
5.  **022.06.03.01.05** -- Give examples of different scenarios and the
    resulting flight director indications.
6.  **022.06.03.01.06** -- Explain that the flight director computes and
    indicates the direction and magnitude of control inputs required in order to
    achieve an attitude to follow a trajectory.
7.  **022.06.03.01.07** -- Explain how the modes available for the flight
    director are the same as those available for the autopilot, and that the
    same panel (FCU/MCP) is normally used for selection.
8.  **022.06.03.01.08** -- Explain the importance of checking the FMC data or
    selected autopilot modes through the FMA when using the flight directors. If
    the flight directors are showing incorrect guidance, they should not be
    followed and should be turned off.
