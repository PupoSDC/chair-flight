# Principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.04.01.01** -- State that DME operates in the UHF band.
2.  **062.02.04.01.02** -- State that the system comprises two basic components:
    the aircraft component: the interrogator; the ground component: the
    transponder.
3.  **062.02.04.01.03** -- Describe the principle of distance measurement using
    DME in terms of a timed transmission from the interrogator and reply from
    the transponder on different frequencies.
4.  **062.02.04.01.04** -- Explain that the distance measured by DME is slant
    range.
5.  **062.02.04.01.05** -- Illustrate that a position line using DME is a circle
    with the station at its centre.
6.  **062.02.04.01.06** -- State that the pairing of VHF and UHF frequencies
    (VOR/DME) enables the selection of two items of navigation information from
    one frequency setting.
7.  **062.02.04.01.07** -- Describe, in the case of co-location with VOR and
    ILS, the frequency pairing and identification procedure.
8.  **062.02.04.01.08** -- State that military UHF tactical air navigation aid
    (TACAN) stations may be used for DME information.

## Summary

<Question id="OA6QPAXLG0" id="0UZ8BqmDuM" lo={['062.02.04.01.04']}>
  <Text variant="oneCorrect">
    You are about to pass overhead a DME station at FL300 with a true
    ground speed of 300kt.${subject} What would your DME instrument read?
  </Text>
<Text variant="oneCorrect">
  An aircraft at FL300 in ISA conditions with a ground speed of 300 NM is about
  to pass over a DME station.${subject} overhead position, What would the DME
  instrument read?
</Text>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-1" subject={[["One minute before the"]]}>
  less than 300kt and 7 NM
</Option>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-2" subject="At the">
  less than 300kt and 5 NM
</Option>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-3">more than 300kt and 7 NM</Option>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-4">more than 300kt and 5 NM</Option>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-5">300kt and 7 NM</Option>
<Option id="0UZ8BqmDuM-6">300kt and 5 NM</Option>

  <Explanation subject={[["One minute before the"]]}>
    When 1 minute before the overhead position you would be 30 000 ft
    above the DME but also `5NM` away on the horizontal plane.

    ```
     30 000 / 6074 = 5 5N
     sqrt(5^2 + 5^2) = 7 NM
    ```

    Since the DME measures the speed of your aircraft based on a slant
    range, it will always under read your ground speed.

  </Explanation>

  <Explanation subject={[["At the"]]}>
    When directly above the overhead position you would be 30 000 ft
    away from the DME. `30 000 / 6074 = 5 NM`.

    Since the DME measures the speed of your aircraft based on a slant
    range, it will always under read your ground speed.
