# Influence of temperature and altitude on Mach number

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.02.01.03.01** -- Explain the absence of change of Mach number with
    varying temperature at constant flight level and calibrated airspeed.
2.  **081.02.01.03.02** -- Explain the relationship between Mach number, TAS and
    IAS during climb and descent at constant Mach number or IAS, and explain
    variation of lift coefficient, alpha, pitch and flight-path angle.
3.  **081.02.01.03.03** -- Explain: risk of exceeding the maximum operation
    speed (VMO) when descending at constant Mach number; risk of exceeding the
    maximum operating Mach number (MMO) when climbing at constant IAS; risk of a
    low-speed stall at high altitude when climbing at a too low Mach number.
