1.  **021.01.01.01.01** -- Describe the following structural design
    philosophies:
    - safe life;
    - fail-safe (multiple load paths);
    - damage-tolerant.
2.  **021.01.01.01.02** -- Explain the purpose of redundancy in aircraft design.

## Summary

### Safe life

In safe-life design, products are intended to be removed from service at a
specific design life.

Safe-life is particularly relevant to simple metal aircraft, where airframe
components are subjected to alternating loads over the lifetime of the aircraft
which makes them susceptible to metal fatigue. In certain areas such as in wing
or tail components, structural failure in flight would be catastrophic.

### Fail Safe

In engineering, a fail-safe is a design feature or practice that in the event of
a specific type of failure, inherently responds in a way that will cause minimal
or no harm to other equipment, to the environment or to people. Unlike inherent
safety to a particular hazard, a system being "fail-safe" does not mean that
failure is impossible or improbable, but rather that the system's design
prevents or mitigates unsafe consequences of the system's failure. That is, if
and when a "fail-safe" system fails, it remains at least as safe as it was
before the failure.

### Damage tolerant

Damage tolerance is a property of a structure relating to its ability to sustain
defects safely until repair can be effected. The approach to engineering design
to account for damage tolerance is based on the assumption that flaws can exist
in any structure and such flaws propagate with usage.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_tolerance)

### Redundancy

Redundancy can be defined as the duplication or triplication of critical
components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability
of said system.

Keep this in mind as the definition of redundancy can easily be confused with
the definition of Fail safe. Redundancy is a key component of fail-safe
structures, but not the only component
