# Autoland: Design and operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.06.05.01.01** -- Explain the purpose of an autoland system.
2.  **022.06.05.01.02** -- Explain the significance of the following components
    required for an autoland:
    - autopilot;
    - autothrust;
    - radio altimeter;
    - ILS receivers.
3.  **022.06.05.01.03** -- Explain the following terms (reference to CS-AWO "All
    Weather Operations"):
    - fail-passive automatic landing system;
    - fail-operational automatic landing system;
    - fail-operational hybrid landing system;
    - alert height.
4.  **022.06.05.01.04** -- Describe the autoland sequence including the
    following:
    - FMAs regarding the landing capability of the aircraft;
    - the significance of monitoring the FMAs to ensure the automatic
      arming/engagement of modes triggered by defined radio altitudes or other
      thresholds;
    - in the event of a go-around, that the aircraft performs the go-around
      manoeuvre both by reading the FMAs and supporting those readings by raw
      data;
    - during the landing phase, that "FLARE" mode engages at the appropriate
      radio altitude, including typical time frame and actions if "FLARE" does
      not engage;
    - after landing, that "ROLL-OUT" mode engages and the significance of
      disconnecting the autopilot prior to vacating the runway.
5.  **022.06.05.01.05** -- Explain that there are operational limitations in
    order to legally perform an autoland beyond the technical capability of the
    aircraft.
6.  **022.06.05.01.06** -- Explain the purpose and significance of alert height,
    describe the indications and implications, and consider typical pilot
    actions for a failure situation:
    - above the alert height;
    - below the alert height.
7.  **022.06.05.01.07** -- Describe typical failures that, if occurring below
    the alert height, will trigger a warning:
    - all autopilots disengage;
    - loss of ILS signal or components thereof;
    - excessive ILS deviations;
    - radio-altimeter failure.
8.  **022.06.05.01.08** -- Describe how the failure of various systems,
    including systems not directly involved in the autoland process, can
    influence the ability to perform an autoland or affect the minima down to
    which the approach may be conducted.
9.  **022.06.05.01.09** -- Describe the fail-operational hybrid landing system
    as a primary fail-passive automatic landing system with a secondary
    independent guidance system such as a head-up display (HUD) to enable the
    pilot to complete a manual landing if the primary system fails.

## Summary

Try not to associate the number of autopilots with Fail Operational vs Fail
Passive redundancy.

A Fail Operational autoland system can have two monitored autopilots or 3
autopilots depending on the aircraft type. Only Fail Operational systems have an
alert height. A single failure in a Fail Operational system allows an autoland
to be completed.

Airbus aircraft with fail operational systems have 2 monitored autopilots, if
one autopilot fails the remaining one is being monitored so it's safe to carry
out an autoland.

Monitored means another system is checking that the autopilot is operating
correctly.

In the same way that the flying pilot is monitored by the non flying pilot on
the approach in case they try to kill you.

On a fly by wire aircraft like the Airbus there are several flight control
computers that can monitor the autopilots, hence there's no need for a 3rd
autopilot to give fail operational redundancy. Inertial information can be used
to monitor an autopilot, some 737NG's have fail operational systems despite only
having 2 autopilots. They use the standby instruments Attitude Heading Reference
System and an electrical autopilot rudder servo to make them CatIIIB capable.
Most 737's are Fail Passive though because Fail Operational is an expensive
option.
