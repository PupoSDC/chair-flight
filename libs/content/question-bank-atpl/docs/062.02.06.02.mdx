# Presentation and interpretation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.06.02.01** -- Interpret the display of airborne equipment designed
    to continuously show the position of the aircraft in relation to a
    preselected course and glide path, along with distance information, during
    approach and departure.
2.  **062.02.06.02.02** -- Explain that segmented approaches can be carried out
    with a presentation with two cross bars directed by a computer which has
    been programmed with the approach to be flown.
3.  **062.02.06.02.03** -- Illustrate that segmented and curved approaches can
    only be executed with DME/P installed.
4.  **062.02.06.02.04** -- Explain why aircraft are equipped with a multimode
    receiver (MMR) in order to be able to receive ILS, MLS and GPS.
5.  **062.02.06.02.05** -- Explain why MLS without DME/P gives an ILS lookalike
    straight-line approach.
