# Types, design, operation, indications

... and warnings, operational limitations

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.07.01.01.01** -- Explain the concepts of anti‑icing and de‑icing.
2.  **021.07.01.01.02** -- Name the components of an aircraft which can be
    protected from ice accretion.
3.  **021.07.01.01.03** -- State that on some aeroplanes the tail does not have
    an ice-protection system.
4.  **021.07.01.01.04** -- State the different types of anti-icing/de-icing
    systems and describe their operating principle:
    - hot air;
    - electrical;
    - fluid.
5.  **021.07.01.01.05** -- Describe the operating principle of the inflatable
    boot de-icing system.
