# Head-up display (HUD), synthetic vision system (SVS) and enhanced visual system (EVS)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.13.07.01.01** -- State the components of a typical HUD installation:
    HUD projector and stowable combiner; HUD controls such as declutter and
    dimmer; HUD computer.
2.  **022.13.07.01.02** -- Explain the reasons and benefits of having an HUD:
    increased situational awareness due to reduced need to look inside to view
    primary flight information; lower minima for both departure and landing;
    improved accuracy of flying thus reduced susceptibility to enter a state of
    aircraft upset.
3.  **022.13.07.01.03** -- Describe how the HUD replicates the information on
    the primary flight display (PFD) by showing the following data: altitude;
    speed, including speed trend; heading; flight path vector (track and
    vertical flight path); flight mode annunciator (FMA); CAS, TAWS and wind
    shear command annunciations.
4.  **022.13.07.01.04** -- Describe the following modes of operation of an HUD:
    normal display mode that may automatically adapt the information based on
    the phase of flight; declutter function.
5.  **022.13.07.01.05** -- Describe the principle of SVS:

- an enhanced database used as reference to provide terrain and ground features
  to be shown on the PFD;
- limitations due to being a synthetic image not based on actual sensory
  information thus not lowering landing minima;
- implications if aircraft position accuracy becomes reduced.

6.  **022.13.07.01.06** -- Describe the principle of EVS:

- includes external sensors such as infrared cameras to generate a real-time
  image on the PFD or on the HUD;
- limitation of the fact that an infrared camera uses temperature and
  temperature difference in order to produce an image;
- enables lower minima because of the real-time image, thus enhancing the
  visibility as experienced by the pilot.
