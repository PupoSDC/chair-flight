# Aircraft-based augmentation systems (ABASs)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.06.02.04.01** -- Explain the principle of ABAS: to use redundant
    elements within the GPS constellation (e.g. multiplicity of distance
    measurements to various satellites) or the combination of GNSS measurements
    with those of other navigation sensors (such as inertial systems) in order
    to develop integrity control.
2.  **062.06.02.04.02** -- State that the type of ABAS using only GNSS
    information is named receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM).
3.  **062.06.02.04.03** -- State that a system using information from additional
    onboard sensors is named aircraft autonomous integrity monitoring (AAIM).
4.  **062.06.02.04.04** -- Explain that the typical sensors used are barometric
    altimeter and inertial reference system (IRS).
