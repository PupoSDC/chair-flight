1.  **021.11.03.08.01** -- State the task of the lubrication system.
2.  **021.11.03.08.02** -- List and describe the common helicopter lubrication
    systems.
3.  **021.11.03.08.03** -- Name the following main components of a helicopter
    lubrication system: reservoir; pump assembly; external oil filter; magnetic
    chip detectors, electronic chip detectors; thermostatic oil coolers;
    breather.
4.  **021.11.03.08.04** -- Identify and name the components of a helicopter
    lubrication system from a diagram.
5.  **021.11.03.08.05** -- Identify the indications used to monitor a
    lubrication system including warning systems.
6.  **021.11.03.08.06** -- Explain the differences and appropriate use of
    straight oil and compound oil, and describe the oil numbering system for
    aviation use.
7.  **021.11.03.08.07** -- Explain and describe the ignition circuit for engine
    start and engine relight facility when the selection is set for both
    automatic and manual functions.
8.  **021.11.03.08.08** -- Explain and describe the starter motor and the
    sequence of events when starting, and that for most helicopters the starter
    becomes the generator after the starting sequence is over.
9.  **021.11.03.08.09** -- Explain and describe why the engine drives the
    accessory gearbox.
