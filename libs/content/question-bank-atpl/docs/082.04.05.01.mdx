# Vertical descent, power on

## Learning Objectives

1.  **082.04.05.01.01** -- Describe the airflow around the rotor disc in a
    trouble-free vertical descent, power on, the airflow opposing the
    helicopter"s velocity, the relative airflow, and alpha.
2.  **082.04.05.01.02** -- Explain the vortex-ring state, also known as settling
    with power. State the approximate vertical descent speeds that allow the
    formation of vortex ring, related to the values of the induced velocities.
3.  **082.04.05.01.03** -- Describe the airflow relative to the blades, the root
    stall, the loss of lift at the blade tip, and the turbulence. Show the
    effect of raising the lever and describe the effects on the controls.
