# Navigation display (ND), electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.13.03.03.01** -- Describe that an ND (or an EHSI) provides a
    mode-selectable colour flight ND.
2.  **022.13.03.03.02** -- List the following four modes typically available to
    be displayed on an ND unit: MAP (or ARC); VOR (or ROSE VOR); APP (or ROSE
    LS); PLAN.
3.  **022.13.03.03.03** -- List and explain the following information that can
    be displayed with the MAP (or ARC) mode selected on an ND unit: aircraft
    symbol, compass scale and range markers; current heading and track (either
    one may be "up" depending on selection), true or magnetic; selected heading
    and track; TAS/GS; wind direction and speed (W/V); raw data radio magnetic
    indicator (RMI) needles/pointers for VOR/automatic direction-finding
    equipment (ADF), if selected, including the frequency or ident of the
    selected navigation facility; route/flight plan data from the FMS; TO/next
    waypoint data from the FMS; data from the navigation database such as
    airports, waypoints or navigation facilities as selected; weather radar
    information; TCAS traffic information (no TCAS commands); TAWS (EGPWS)
    terrain information; failure flags and messages.
4.  **022.13.03.03.04** -- List and explain the following information that can
    be displayed with the VOR or APP (or ROSE VOR or ROSE LS) mode selected on
    an ND unit: aircraft symbol and compass scale; current heading and track
    (either one may be "up" depending on selection), true or magnetic; selected
    heading and track; TAS/ground speed (GS); wind direction and speed (W/V);
    VOR or ILS frequency and identification of the selected navigation aid; VOR
    selected course, deviation indicator and a TO/FROM indicator in a HSI-type
    display format when in VOR mode; localiser selected course, deviation
    indicator and glideslope indicator in a HSI-type display format when in APP
    mode. weather radar information; TCAS traffic information (no TCAS
    commands); TAWS (EGPWS) terrain information; failure flags and messages.
5.  **022.13.03.03.05** -- List and explain the following information that can
    be displayed with the PLAN mode selected on an ND unit: north-up compass
    rose and range markers; aircraft symbol oriented according to aircraft
    heading; TAS/GS; wind direction and speed (W/V); route/flight plan data from
    the FMS; TO/next waypoint data from the FMS; data from the navigation
    database such as airports, waypoints or navigation facilities as selected;
    failure flags and messages.
6.  **022.13.03.03.06** -- Explain the purpose of PLAN mode and its
    characteristics such as: no compass information; north is up on the display
    unit at all times; the centre waypoint is the selected waypoint on the FMS
    CDU; scrolling through the flight plan on the FMS CDU will shift the map
    view along the flight path; the aircraft symbol will be positioned in the
    appropriate place along the flight path; using PLAN mode as the primary mode
    during flight may lead to disorientation and loss of situational awareness.
7.  **022.13.03.03.07** -- Distinguish the difference between the appearance of
    an EXPANDED or FULL/ROSE mode and how the displayed range differs between
    them.
8.  **022.13.03.03.08** -- Explain the combination of mode and range selection
    including how selecting the appropriate range and displayed data can improve
    situational awareness for a given phase of flight.
