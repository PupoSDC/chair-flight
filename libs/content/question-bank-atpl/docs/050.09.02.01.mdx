# Effects on flight, avoidance

## Learning Objectives

1.  **050.09.02.01.01** -- State the ICAO qualifying terms for the intensity of
    turbulence.
2.  **050.09.02.01.02** -- Describe the effects of turbulence on an aircraft in
    flight.
3.  **050.09.02.01.03** -- Indicate the possibilities of avoiding turbulence: in
    the flight planning: weather briefing, selection of track and altitude;
    during flight: selection of appropriate track and altitude.
4.  **050.09.02.01.04** -- Describe atmospheric turbulence and distinguish
    between turbulence, gustiness and wind shear.
5.  **050.09.02.01.05** -- Describe that forecasts of turbulence are not very
    reliable and state that pilot reports of turbulence are very valuable as
    they help others to prepare for or avoid turbulence.
