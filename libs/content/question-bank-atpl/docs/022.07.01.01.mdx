## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.07.01.01.01** -- Explain the similarities and differences between SAS
    and AFCS (the latter can actually fly the helicopter to perform certain
    functions selected by the pilot). Some AFCSs just have altitude and heading
    hold whilst others include a vertical speed or IAS hold mode, where a
    constant rate of climb/decent or IAS is maintained by the AFCS.
