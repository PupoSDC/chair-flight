  <Text variant="oneCorrect">

  </Text>
  <Option
    subject={[["low resistance and low capacity"]]}
    why="When temperature increases the loop resistance is supposed to decrease, and its capacitance is supposed to increase. If both of these decrease at the same time, the loop must be faulty."
  >
    The loop is faulty
  </Option>
  <Option subject={[["low resistance"], ["low capacity"]]}>
