# Autopilot system : Design and operation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.06.02.01.01** -- Define the three basic control channels.
2.  **022.06.02.01.02** -- Define the three different types of autopilots:
    - single or 1 axis (roll);
    - 2 axes (pitch and roll);
    - 3 axes (pitch, roll and yaw).
3.  **022.06.02.01.03** -- Describe the purpose of the following components of
    an autopilot system:
    - flight control unit (FCU),
    - mode control panel (MCP) or equivalent;
    - flight mode annunciator (FMA)
4.  **022.06.02.01.04** -- Explain the following lateral modes:
    - heading (HDG)/track (TRK);
    - VOR (VOR)/localiser (LOC);
    - lateral navigation/managed navigation (LNAV or NAV).
5.  **022.06.02.01.05** -- Describe the purpose of control laws for pitch and
    roll modes.
6.  **022.06.02.01.06** -- Explain the following vertical modes: vertical speed
    (V/S); flight path angle (FPA); level change (LVL CHG)/open climb (OP CLB)
    or open descent (OP DES); speed reference system (SRS); altitude (ALT) hold;
    vertical navigation (VNAV)/managed climb (CLB) or descent (DES); glideslope
    (G/S).
7.  **022.06.02.01.07** -- Describe how the autopilot uses speed, aircraft
    configuration or flight phase as a measure for the magnitude of control
    inputs and how this may affect precision and stability.
8.  **022.06.02.01.08** -- Explain the following mixed modes: take-off;
    go-around; approach (APP).
9.  **022.06.02.01.09** -- Describe the two types of autopilot configurations
    and explain the implications to the pilot for either and when comparing the
    two principles: flight-deck controls move with the control surface when the
    autopilot is engaged; flight-deck controls remain static when the autopilot
    is engaged.
10. **022.06.02.01.10** -- Describe the purpose of the following inputs and
    outputs for an autopilot system: attitude information; flight
    path/trajectory information; control surface position information; airspeed
    information; aircraft configuration information; FCU/MCP selections; FMAs.
11. **022.06.02.01.11** -- Describe the purpose of the synchronisation function
    when engaging the autopilot and explain why the autopilot should be engaged
    when the aircraft is in trim.
12. **022.06.02.01.12** -- Define the control wheel steering (CWS) mode as
    manual manoeuvring of the aircraft through the autopilot computer and
    autopilot servos/actuators using the control column/control wheel.
13. **022.06.02.01.13** -- Describe the following elements of CWS: CWS as an
    autopilot mode; flight phases where CWS cannot be used; whether the pilot or
    the autopilot is controlling the flight path; the availability of flight
    path/performance protections; potential different feel and control response
    compared to manual flight.
14. **022.06.02.01.14** -- Describe touch control steering (TCS) and highlight
    the differences when compared to CWS: autopilot remains engaged but
    autopilot servos/actuators are disconnected from the control surfaces;
    manual control of the aircraft as long as TCS button is depressed; autopilot
    servos/actuators reconnect when TCS button is released and the autopilot
    returns to previously engaged mode(s).
15. **022.06.02.01.15** -- Explain that only one autopilot may be engaged at any
    time except for when APP is armed in order to facilitate a fail-operational
    autoland.
16. **022.06.02.01.16** -- Explain the difference between an armed and an
    engaged mode: not all modes have an armed state available; a mode will only
    become armed if certain criteria are met; an armed mode will become engaged
    (replacing the previously engaged mode, if any) when certain criteria are
    met.
17. **022.06.02.01.17** -- Describe the sequence of events when a mode is
    engaged and the different phases: initial phase where attitude is changed to
    obtain a new trajectory in order to achieve the new parameter; the
    trajectory will be based on rate of closure which is again based on the
    difference between the original parameter and the new parameter; capture
    phase where the aircraft will follow a predefined rate of change of
    trajectory to achieve the new parameter without overshooting/ undershooting;
    tracking or hold phase where the aircraft will maintain the set parameter
    until a new change has been initiated.
18. **022.06.02.01.18** -- Explain automatic mode reversion and typical
    situations where it may occur: no suitable data for the current mode such as
    flight plan discontinuity when in LNAV/managed NAV; change of parameter
    during capture phase for original parameter such as change of altitude
    target during ALT ACQ/ALT\*; mismanagement of a mode resulting in engagement
    of the autopilot envelope protection, e.g. selecting excessive V/S resulting
    in a loss of speed control.
19. **022.06.02.01.19** -- Explain the dangers of mismanagement of the following
    modes: use of V/S and lack of speed protection, i.e. excessive V/S or FPA
    may be selected with subsequent uncontrolled loss or gain of airspeed;
    arming VOR/LOC or APP outside the protected area of the localiser or ILS.
20. **022.06.02.01.20** -- Describe how failure of other systems may influence
    the availability of the autopilot and how incorrect data from other systems
    may result in an undesirable aircraft state, potentially without any failure
    indications. Explain the importance of prompt and appropriate pilot
    intervention during such events.
21. **022.06.02.01.21** -- Explain an appropriate procedure for disengaging the
    autopilot and why both aural and visual warnings are used to indicate that
    the autopilot is being disengaged: temporary warning for intended
    disengagement using the design method; continuous warning for unintended
    disengagement or using a method other than the design method.
22. **022.06.02.01.22** -- Explain the following regarding autopilot and
    aircraft with manual trim: the autopilot may not engage unless the aircraft
    controls are in trim; the aircraft will normally be in trim when the
    autopilot is disconnected; use of manual trim when the autopilot is engaged
    will normally lead to autopilot disconnection and a risk of an out-of-trim
    situation.
