# Take-off performance, definitions of and relationships between terms

## Learning Objectives

1.  **032.04.01.01.01** -- Explain the forces affecting the aeroplane during the
    take-off run.
2.  **032.04.01.01.02** -- State the effects of thrust-to-weight ratio and
    flap-setting on ground roll.
3.  **032.04.01.01.03** -- Describe the European Union airworthiness
    requirements according to CS-25 relating to large aeroplane performance
    (General and Take-off).
4.  **032.04.01.01.04** -- Describe the terms "aircraft classification number"
    (ACN) and "pavement classification number" (PCN), and the requirements and
    hazards of operating on aerodrome surfaces with PCNs smaller than the ACNs.
5.  **032.04.01.01.05** -- Define and explain the following speeds in accordance
    with CS-25 or CS-Definitions: reference stall speed (VSR); reference stall
    speed in a specific configuration (VSR1.; 1-g stall speed at which the
    aeroplane can develop a lift force (normal to the flight path) equal to its
    weight (VS1g); minimum control speed with critical engine inoperative (VMC);
    minimum control speed on or near the ground (VMCG); minimum control speed at
    take-off climb (VMCA); engine failure speed (VEF); take-off decision speed
    (V1.; rotation speed (VR); take-off safety speed (V2.; minimum take-off
    safety speed (V2MIN); minimum unstick speed (VMU); lift-off speed (VLOF);
    maximum brake energy speed (VMBE); maximum tyre speed (VMax Tyre).
6.  **032.04.01.01.06** -- Explain the interdependence between the
    above-mentioned speeds where relevant.
7.  **032.04.01.01.07** -- Define the following distances in accordance with
    CS-25: take-off run with all engines operating and one-engine- inoperative;
    take-off distance with all engines operating and one-engine-inoperative;
    accelerate-stop distance with all engines operating and
    one-engine-inoperative.
8.  **032.04.01.01.08** -- Explain how loss of TORA due to alignment is
    accounted for.
9.  **032.04.01.01.09** -- Explain the effect of the interdependency of relevant
    speeds in 032 04 01 01 (05. and the situations in which these
    interdependencies can cause speed and performance restrictions.
