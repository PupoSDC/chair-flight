## Learning Objectives

1.  **040.03.07.03.01** -- Explain that the potential disadvantages of
    automation on crew communication are loss of awareness of input errors,
    flight modes, failure detection, failure comprehension, status of the
    aircraft and aircraft position.
2.  **040.03.07.03.02** -- Explain how the negative effects of automation on
    pilots may be alleviated by degrading to a lower level of automation to
    recover comprehension of the flight status from VNAV/LNAV to ALT/HDG or even
    to manual flying.
3.  **040.03.07.03.03** -- Interpret the role of automation with respect to
    flight safety regarding the basic principle of the use of manual versus
    autoflight in normal operations, frequent changes in the flight profile, and
    in abnormal situations.
