# Aeroplane: fly-by-wire (FBW) control systems

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.05.04.01.01** -- Explain that an FBW flight control system is composed
    of the following:
    - pilot's input command (control column/sidestick/rudder pedals);
    - electrical signalling paths, including: pilot input to computer;
    - computer to flight control surfaces;
    - feedback from aircraft response tocomputer;
    - flight control computers;
    - actuators;
    - flight control surfaces.
2.  **021.05.04.01.02** -- State the advantages of an FBW system in comparison
    with a conventional flight control system including:
    - weight;
    - pilot workload;
    - flight-envelope protection.
3.  **021.05.04.01.03** -- Explain why an FBW system is always irreversible.
4.  **021.05.04.01.04** -- Explain the different modes of operation: normal
    operation (e.g. normal law or normal mode); downgraded operation (e.g.
    alternate law or secondary mode); direct law.
5.  **021.05.04.01.05** -- Describe the implications of mode degradation in
    relation to pilot workload and flight-envelope protection.
6.  **021.05.04.01.07** -- For aircraft using sidestick for manual control,
    describe the implications of: dual control input made by the pilot; the
    control takeover facility available to the pilot.
7.  **021.05.04.01.09** -- Explain why several types of computers are needed and
    why they should be dissimilar.
8.  **021.05.04.01.10** -- Explain why several control surfaces on every axis
    are needed on FBW aircraft.
9.  **021.05.04.01.11** -- Explain why several sensors are needed on critical
    parameters.

## Summary

- **PFC**: Primary Flight Computer. Receives Pilot commands, checks them for
  viability and errors, and converts them into the final digital signal to be
  sent to the **ACE**.
- **ACE**: Actuator Control Electronics. Recieves a digital signal from the
  **PFC** and converts it into an analogue signal to be sent to the **PCU**.
- **PCU**: Power Control Unit. Receives electric analogue and activates an
  Hydraulic actuator

  </Text>
  <Option correct>
    The link between the pilot inputs and control surfaces is done indirectly
    via a computer
  </Option>
  <Option>
    A pilot can reverse the inputs of the autopilot system as they also have a
    direct link to the hydraulic actuators of the control surfaces
  </Option>
  <Option>
    it is linked mechanically to a computer and then to the flight control
    surfaces
  </Option>
  <Option>

    Used throughout the entire flight from the chocks off to chocks on. It

    A reduced mode of operation that is activated on deterioration of the
    fly-by-wire system. Most protections will remain active, while some will be
    replaced by warnings to the pilot.

  <Option
    subject={[["Direct Law"]]}
    why="This is an 'airbus only' mode. NOTE: this is not part of the LO's"
