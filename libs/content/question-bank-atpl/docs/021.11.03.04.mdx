## Summary

### Auxiliary gearbox

The auxiliary gearbox is a way to extract power from the turbine engine shaft
for uses other than providing thrust. This system is used to supply energy to
pretty much all other systems in an aircraft that require power, such as:

- Starter
- Oil pump
- Tachometers
- HP Fuel Pumps
- Hydraulic Pumps
- AC generator

<Option why="Pneumatic systems are out of use in modern airliners, and are used only in emergency systems. Regardless, when they were in use, they relied on compressed &#x22;gas&#x22; canisters to supply the pressure to the system. These cannisters were not usually rechargeable  in flight, but when they were, they used a secondary system not directly powered by the auxiliary gearbox.">
