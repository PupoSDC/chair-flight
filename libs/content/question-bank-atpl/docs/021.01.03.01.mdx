# Describe and explain fatigue and corrosion

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.01.03.01.01** -- Describe the effects of corrosion and how it can be
    visually identified by a pilot during the pre-flight inspection.
2.  **021.01.03.01.02** -- Describe the operating environments where the risk of
    corrosion is increased and how to minimise the effects of the environmental
    factors.
3.  **021.01.03.01.03** -- Explain that aircraft have highly corrosive fluids on
    board as part of their systems and equipment.
4.  **021.01.03.01.04** -- Explain fatigue, how it affects the useful life of an
    aircraft, and the effect of the following factors on the development of
    fatigue:
    - corrosion;
    - number of cycles;
    - type of flight manoeuvres;
    - stress level;
    - level and quality of maintenance.
