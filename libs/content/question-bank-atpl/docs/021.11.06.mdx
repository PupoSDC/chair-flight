## Summary

Auxiliary Power Units (APU)s are small gas turbines usually located at the back
of the aircraft that drive an electrical generator to power aircraft systems.
They are typically used on the ground before the main engines are turned on.

Additional to supplying electrical power, APUs can also supply compressed air
for starting the main engine or for air conditioning

Due to its secondary role, APUs rely on only a "Fault status" indicator to be
monitored. Similarly, APUs are usually started by a flick of a switch.

Since the APU primary role is to supply electrical power, its setup is
significantly simpler than the one for main engines, mostly because there is no
need for a Constant Speed Drive: the APU already operates at a constant speed.
However, because of this it's not possible to run this generator in parallel
with the main engine generators. As such, when selecting the APU as a power
source, the other sources are disconnected. Regardless, as all other generators,
the APU supplies power in three-phase, 115-120V, 400Hz AC.

APUS must be equipped with an automatic shutdown protection system that
activates when:

- EGT limit is exceeded,
- APU Fire
- Low oil pressure
- High oil temperature

In any engine, Low oil pressure typically indicates a leak, which will
eventually result in either overheating or not enough lubrication causing
mechanical damage. High oil pressure is usually not problematic and is kept in
check by pressure release valves.

Remember: `High Temperature and Low Pressure => BAD!`.
