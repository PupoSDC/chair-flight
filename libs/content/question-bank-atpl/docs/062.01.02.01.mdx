# Characteristics

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.01.02.01.01** -- Define "antenna": an antenna or aerial is an
    electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice
    versa.
2.  **062.01.02.01.02** -- State that the simplest type of antenna is a dipole,
    which is a wire of length equal to one half of the wavelength.
3.  **062.01.02.01.03** -- State that an electromagnetic wave always consists of
    an oscillating electric (E) and an oscillating magnetic (H) field which
    propagates at the speed of light.
4.  **062.01.02.01.04** -- State that the E and H fields are perpendicular to
    each other. The oscillations are perpendicular to the propagation direction
    and are in-phase.
