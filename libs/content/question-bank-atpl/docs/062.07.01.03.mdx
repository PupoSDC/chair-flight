# PBN scope

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.01.03.01** -- State that in oceanic/remote, en-route and terminal
    phases of flight, PBN is limited to operations with linear lateral
    performance requirements and time constraints.
2.  **062.07.01.03.02** -- State that in the approach phases of flight, PBN
    accommodates both linear and angular laterally guided operations, and
    explain the difference between the two.
