# Fuel gauge

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.01.03.01.01** -- State that the quantity of fuel can be measured by
    volume or mass.
2.  **022.01.03.01.02** -- List the following units used for fuel quantity:
    kilogramme; pound; litres; gallons (US and imperial).
3.  **022.01.03.01.03** -- Convert between the various units.
4.  **022.01.03.01.04** -- Explain the parameters that can affect the
    measurement of the volume or mass of the fuel in a fuel tank: temperature;
    aircraft accelerations and attitudes; and explain how the fuel-gauge system
    design compensates for these changes.
5.  **022.01.03.01.05** -- Describe and explain the operating principles of the
    following types of fuel gauges:
    - float system;
    - capacitance-type of fuel-gauge system.
    - ultrasound-type of fuel-gauge system: to be introduced at a later date.
6.  **022.01.03.01.06** -- Describe and complete a typical post-refuelling
    procedure for a pilot: recording the volume that was filled; converting to
    the appropriate unit used by the aircraft fuel gauge(s) to compare the
    actual indicated fuel content to the calculated fuel content; assess
    appropriate action if the numbers does not compare.
