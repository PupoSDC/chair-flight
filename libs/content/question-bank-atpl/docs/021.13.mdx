    Which of these statements concerning oxygen on board of passenger transport
    aeroplanes is correct?
  </Text>
<Option correct>
  Portable oxygen bottles in the cabin are primarily intended for first aid
  purposes.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  After being activated a chemical oxygen generator produces heat.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  Chemical oxygen generators are provided with an heat shield.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  Lavatories must be fitted with a fixed oxygen system that is activated at the
  same time as the cabin system.
</Option>
<Option why="lavatories must be equipped with an oxygen system as any other cabin location">
  Since lavatories are not fitted with an oxygen system, they should be
  evacuated quickly in case of decompression.
</Option>
<Option why="chemical generators heat up when activated">
  After being activated a chemical oxygen generator does not produce any heat.
</Option>
<Option why="chemical generators typically have a lifespan of less than 15 mins as they are intended to supply oxygen only during enough time to allow the aircraft to descend below 10.000ft">
  A chemical oxygen generator is able to provide oxygen for at least one hour.
</Option>

  <Option why="their primary use is for first aid purposes.">
    Portable oxygen bottles are primarily intended for use in case the chemical
    oxygen generators fail.

    An oxygen supply system must be kept free of oil or grease as...
  </Text>
<Option
  correct
  why="Spontaneous in this case means 'without the need of a spark'"
>
  these substances can catch fire spontaneously in the presence of oxygen.
</Option>
<Option correct>
  the interaction of oil and and oxygen creates a fire hazard.
</Option>
<Option>these substances could block the oxygen mask filters.</Option>
<Option>
  The interaction of oil-based products and oxygen creates a non-flammable
  smoke, which reduces visibility.
</Option>
<Option>the breathing oxygen could be contaminated by these substances.</Option>
<Option>
  Oxygen absorbs oil and grease particles, causing the oxygen to become toxic.
</Option>
<Option why="Although correct, maintaining good oil lubrication properties is not even close to a priority in an oxygen system.">
  The interaction of oxygen and oil-based products reduces the lubricating
  capacity of those products.
</Option>

  <Option why="no spark is necessary. 100% oxygen is usually enough to ignite most combustible mixtures">
    these substances mixed with oxygen could catch fire in the presence of a
    spark.
