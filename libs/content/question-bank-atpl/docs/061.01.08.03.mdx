# Ground speed (GS)/distance covered during climb or descent

## Learning Objectives

1.  **061.01.08.03.01** -- State that most aircraft operating handbooks supply
    graphical material to calculate climb and descent problems.
2.  **061.01.08.03.02** -- Calculate the flying time and distance during
    climb/descent from given average rate of climb/descent and using average GS
    using the following formulae valid for a 3-degree-glide path: rate of
    descent \= (GS × 10. / 2 rate of descent = speed factor (SF) × glide-path
    angle × 100
3.  **061.01.08.03.03** -- Given distance, speed and present altitude, calculate
    the rate of climb/descent in order to reach a certain position at a given
    altitude.
4.  **061.01.08.03.04** -- Given speed, rate of climb/descent and altitude,
    calculate the distance required in order to reach a certain position at a
    given altitude.
5.  **061.01.08.03.05** -- Given speed, distance to go and altitude to
    climb/descent, calculate the rate of climb/descent.
