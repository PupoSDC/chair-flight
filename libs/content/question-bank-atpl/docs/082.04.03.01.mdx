# Airflow and forces in uniform inflow distribution

## Learning Objectives

1.  **082.04.03.01.01** -- Explain the assumption of a uniform inflow
    distribution on the rotor disc.
2.  **082.04.03.01.02** -- Show the upstream air velocities relative to the
    blade elements and the different effects on the advancing and retreating
    blades. Define the area of reverse flow. Explain the influence of forward
    speed on the circumferential speed of the blade tip.
3.  **082.04.03.01.03** -- Assuming constant pitch angles and rigid blade
    attachments, explain the roll moment from the asymmetric distribution of L.
4.  **082.04.03.01.04** -- Show that through cyclic feathering this imbalance
    could be eliminated by a low alpha (accomplished by a low pitch angle) on
    the advancing blade, and a high alpha (accomplished by a high pitch angle)
    on the retreating blade.
5.  **082.04.03.01.05** -- Describe the high air velocity at the advancing blade
    tip and the compressibility effects which limit maximum speed.
6.  **082.04.03.01.06** -- Describe the low air velocity on the retreating blade
    tip resulting from the difference between the circumferential speed and
    forward speed, the need for high alpha, and the onset of stall.
7.  **082.04.03.01.07** -- Define the blade tip speed ratio.
8.  **082.04.03.01.08** -- Explain the total rotor thrust that is perpendicular
    to the rotor disc and the need for tilting the thrust vector forward.
9.  **082.04.03.01.09** -- Explain the conditions of equilibrium in steady
    straight and level flight.
