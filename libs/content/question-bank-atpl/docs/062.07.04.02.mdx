# On-board performance monitoring and alerting

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.04.02.01** -- State that on-board performance monitoring and
    alerting of flight technical errors is managed by on-board systems or flight
    crew procedures.
2.  **062.07.04.02.02** -- State that on-board performance monitoring and
    alerting of navigation system errors is a requirement of on-board equipment
    for RNP.
3.  **062.07.04.02.03** -- State that, dependent on the navigation sensor, the
    estimated position error (EPE) is compared with the required navigation
    specification.
4.  **062.07.04.02.04** -- Explain how a navigation system assesses the EPE.
5.  **062.07.04.02.05** -- Give an example of how the loss of the ability to
    operate in RNP airspace may be indicated by the navigation system.
6.  **062.07.04.02.06** -- State that on-board performance monitoring and
    alerting of path definition error is managed by gross reasonableness checks
    of navigation data.
