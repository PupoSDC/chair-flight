# Purpose, operation, overcompensation, speed control

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.09.01.01.01** -- Describe the purpose of the autothrust system and
    explain how the FMAs will be the only indication on active autothrust modes.
2.  **022.09.01.01.02** -- Explain the operation of an autothrust system with
    regard to the following modes: take-off/go-around (TOGA); climb or maximum
    continuous thrust (MCT), N1 or EPR targeted (THR CLB, THR MCT, N1, THR HOLD,
    EPR); speed (SPEED, MCP SPD); idle thrust (THR IDLE, RETARD/ARM); landing
    (RETARD, THR IDLE).
3.  **022.09.01.01.03** -- Describe the two main variants of autothrust systems:
    mode selections available on the FCU/MCP and thrust levers move with
    autothrust commands; mode selections made using the thrust levers which
    remain static during autothrust operation.
4.  **022.09.01.01.04** -- Explain how flight in turbulence/wind shear giving
    fluctuating airspeed indications may lead to the autothrust overcompensating
    in an oscillating manner and that manual thrust may be required to settle
    the airspeed. Airspeed indications/trend vectors may give an indication of
    appropriate thrust adjustments but any reaction should not be too
    aggressive.
5.  **022.09.01.01.05** -- Explain the threats associated with the use of
    autothrust resulting in the pilot losing the sense of energy awareness (e.g.
    speed, thrust).
6.  **022.09.01.01.06** -- Explain the relationship between autopilot pitch
    modes and autothrust modes, and how the autopilot and autothrust will
    interact upon selecting modes for one of the systems.
7.  **022.09.01.01.07** -- Explain the principles of speed control and how speed
    can be controlled: by varying the engine thrust; by varying the aircraft
    pitch.
8.  **022.09.01.01.08** -- Explain the potential implications on speed control
    when the autothrust controls speed and the autopilot pitch channel has a
    fixed pitch target for the following mode combinations: MCP SPD/SPEED and
    ALT HOLD/ALT; MCP SPD/SPEED and VSP (climb); MCP SPD/SPEED and VSP
    (descent).
9.  **022.09.01.01.09** -- Explain the potential implications on speed control
    when the autothrust has a fixed thrust target and the autopilot pitch
    channel controls speed for the following mode combinations: N1/THR CLB and
    LVL CHG/OP CLB; ARM/THR IDLE and LVL CHG/OP DES.
