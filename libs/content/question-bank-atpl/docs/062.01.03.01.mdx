# Structure of the ionosphere and its effect on radio waves

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.01.03.01.01** -- State that the ionosphere is the ionised component of
    the Earth"s upper atmosphere from approximately 60 to 400 km above the
    surface, which is vertically structured in three regions or layers.
2.  **062.01.03.01.02** -- State that the layers of the ionosphere are named D,
    E and F layers, and their depth varies with time.
3.  **062.01.03.01.03** -- State that electromagnetic waves refracted from the E
    and F layers of the ionosphere are called sky waves.
4.  **062.01.03.01.04** -- Explain how the different layers of the ionosphere
    influence wave propagation.
