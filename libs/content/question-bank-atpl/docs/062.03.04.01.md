  Which of the following constitute an advantage of Secondary surveillance Radar
  when compared to a Primary surveillance Radar system?
</Text>
<Option
  correct
  why="As each signal only needs to follow one path (instead of all possible paths in the sky) attenuation is significantly decreased reducing power consumption"
>
  The required power of transmission from the ground equipment is reduced
</Option>
<Option
  correct
  why="Contrary to normal radars SSR relies on a response sent directly from the aircraft transponder. The best of stealth aircraft would still be clearly visible on radar, if they have their transponders on."
>
  The quality of radar identification is not dependent on the target size,
  aspect, shape, or material
</Option>
<Option
  correct
  why="Transponders communicate at least a transponder code (7000, 2000, etc...), but can also transmit altitude and identification information."
>
  Ground stations can obtain coded information from the surveilled aircraft such
  as identification and altitude
</Option>
<Option subject={[[]]}>
  ATC SSR systems can interrogate aircraft transponders and elicit replies
</Option>
<Option why="This is false. SSR still requires line of sight to operate">
  Is not limited by line of sight
</Option>
<Option why="This information is not transmitted by SSR. It can be derived from multiple SSR interrogations but it's not coded information from the surveilled aircraft.">
  Ground stations can obtain coded information from the surveilled aircraft such
  as speed and heading
</Option>
<Option why="SSR still emits side lobes.">
  The relatively small ground antenna transmits no side lobes, thus eliminating
  the danger of false replies from the airborne transponder.
</Option>

  <Option why="The flow of information is the other way around. The Ground system is the one making interrogations.">
    ATC SSR systems can reply to an aircraft interrogation and provide elicit
    replies
  </Option>
</Question>
