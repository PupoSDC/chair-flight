# Enhancement of helicopter capability

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.07.01.03.01** -- Explain how an AFCS improves helicopter flight safety
    during: search and rescue (SAR) because of increased capabilities; flight by
    sole reference to instruments; underslung load operations; white-out
    conditions in snow-covered landscapes; an approach to land with lack of
    visual cues.
2.  **022.07.01.03.02** -- Explain that the SAR modes of AFCS include the
    following functions: ability to autohover; facility for mark on target (MOT)
    approach to hover; automatically transition from cruise down to a
    predetermined point or over-flown point; ability for the rear crew to move
    the helicopter around in the hover; the ability to automatically transition
    from the hover back to cruise flight; the ability to fly various search
    patterns.
3.  **022.07.01.03.03** -- Explain that earlier autohover systems use Doppler
    velocity sensors and modern systems use inertial sensors plus GPS, and
    normally include a two-dimensional hover-velocity indicator for the pilots.
4.  **022.07.01.03.04** -- Explain why some SAR helicopters have both
    radio-altimeter height hold and barometric altitude hold.
