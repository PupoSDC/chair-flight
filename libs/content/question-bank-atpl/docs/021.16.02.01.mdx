# Types, operational considerations

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.16.02.01.01** -- Describe the main function of the disc type of rotor
    brake.
2.  **021.16.02.01.02** -- Describe both hydraulic- and cable-operated
    rotor-brake systems.
3.  **021.16.02.01.03** -- Describe the different options for the location of
    the rotor brake.
4.  **021.16.02.01.04** -- List the following operational considerations for the
    use of rotor brakes: rotor speed at engagement of rotor brake; risk of blade
    sailing in windy conditions; risk of rotor-brake overheating and possible
    fire when brake is applied above the maximum limit, particularly when
    spilled hydraulic fluid is present; avoid stopping blades over jet-pipe
    exhaust with engine running; cockpit annunciation of rotor-brake operation.
