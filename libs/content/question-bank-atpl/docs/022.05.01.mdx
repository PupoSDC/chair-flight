# Inertial Navigation: Basic principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.05.01.01.01** -- State that inertial navigation/reference systems are
    the main source of attitude and one of the main sources of navigational data
    in commercial air transport aeroplanes.
2.  **022.05.01.01.02** -- State that inertial systems require no external
    input, except TAS, to determine aircraft attitude and navigational data.
3.  **022.05.01.01.03** -- State that earlier gyro mechanically stabilised
    platforms are (technically incorrectly but conventionally) referred to as
    inertial navigation systems (INSs) and more modern fixed (strap down)
    platforms are conventionally referred to as inertial reference systems
    (IRSs). INSs can be considered to be stand-alone, whereas IRSs are
    integrated with the FMS.
4.  **022.05.01.01.04** -- Explain the basic principles of inertial navigation
    (including double integration of measured acceleration and the necessity for
    north–south, east–west and vertical components to be measured/extracted).
5.  **022.05.01.01.05** -- Explain the necessity of applying correction for
    transport precession, and Earth rate precession, coriolis and gravity.
6.  **022.05.01.01.06** -- State that in modern aircraft fitted with inertial
    reference system (IRS) and flight management system (FMS), the flight
    management computer (FMC) position is normally derived from a mathematical
    analysis of IRS, global positioning system (GPS), and distance measuring
    equipment (DME) data, VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and LOC.
7.  **022.05.01.01.07** -- List all navigational data that can be determined by
    a stand-alone inertial navigation system.
8.  **022.05.01.01.08** -- State that a strap-down system is fixed to the
    structure of the aircraft and normally consists of three laser ring gyros
    and three accelerometers.
9.  **022.05.01.01.09** -- State the differences between a laser ring gyro and a
    conventional mechanical gyro.
