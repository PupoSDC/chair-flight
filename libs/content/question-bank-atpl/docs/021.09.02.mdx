## Summary

An electric battery is a source of electric power consisting of one or more
electrochemical cells with external connections for powering electrical devices.

When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode
and its negative terminal is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the
source of electrons that will flow through an external electric circuit to the
positive terminal.

When a battery is connected to an external electric load, a redox reaction
converts high-energy reactants to lower-energy products, and the free-energy
difference is delivered to the external circuit as electrical energy.
Historically the term "battery" specifically referred to a device composed of
multiple cells; however, the usage has evolved to include devices composed of a
single cell.

Since battery cells are able to produce relatively low voltage, they are placed
in series to achieve higher voltage levels. This means that

**if one cell fails, the entire battery is rendered inoperative**

### Thermal runaway

Generally, charging a battery will cause it to heat up. Think about how warm an
older phone can get get as it charging. However this heating up is kept in check
as long as the current being sent to the battery is within limits.

Thermal runaway occurs when over charging of a battery takes place. Under these
circumstances, battery temperature quickly increases, increasing the rate of the
chemical transformations occurring within a cell which leads to even more
heating, leading to a vicious cycle. Eventually, the electrolyte will boil
resulting in a fire or explosion.

Thermal runaway can be prevented by monitoring battery temperature, and stopping
to charge if the temperature gets too high.
