## Summary

### Landing Gear Components

#### Oleo leg/shock strut;

Inside the shock strut...

#### Axles;

#### Bogies and bogie beam;

#### Drag struts;

#### Side stays/struts;

#### Torsion links;

#### Locks (over centre)

When the landing gear movement command is issued, the first step in the process
is to unlock the over centre lock. Then, when reaching the final position,
another over-centre mechanism locks the landing gear in place.

For the "down lock", the lock works under spring tension, meaning that hydraulic
force must be present to unlock the gear, but not to lock it. In other words,
this lock is a bit like any door lock, where you can just push the door to close
it, but you need to operate a mechanism (the handle) to open it.

For the "up lock", hydraulic pressure is used to maintain the lock state. If the
hydraulic pressure is removed (intentionally, or in case of failure), the
landing gear will be free to operate, and usually fall into the down position.

Landing gear operation is said to be complete, and fully locked once this lock
is in place.

### Operation Lights

Landing gear leavers are accompanied by a set of 2 lights per each landing gear
unit (typically 3). Each set of lights contains one red, and one green light.
There are 3 possible states:

- Green light: Landing gear Down and locked!
- No light: Landing gear up and locked!
- Red light: Gear in transfer!

An aural warning is installed to alert if the plane is at too close to the
ground without having the landing gear extended. This warning usually comes from
GPWS and says **"TOO LOW - GEAR"**.

### Ground protection devices

Operating the landing gear on the ground is generally considered a bad idea, so
mechanisms have been devised to prevent it.

The first mechanism is known as an **Anti-retract latch**. When the aircraft is
on the ground, its weight compresses the landing gear activating a sensor which
trigger a latch mechanism that prevents the landing gear lever from being moved.
This latch has an override mechanism in case of a false positive (i.e.: the
latch still being active after take off).

Another mechanism that is commonly used during long stops consists of a safety
pin is inserted into the landing gear lock to prevent operation. These pins must
be accompanied by the famous red "REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT" tags.

### Limiting Speeds

- V<sub>le</sub> = Maximum speed with landing gear extended
- V<sub>lo</sub> = Maximum speed with landing gear extended

### Emergency Gear extension methods

#### Free Fall

There are 3 steps in this process:

1.  The cut out valve and the vent vales are released,
2.  The door up-locks are released (due to the removal of hydraulic pressure)
3.  The gear locks are released

This allows the landing gear to fall into position using its own weight. It's
not unusual for the emergency checklist to include a step to "rock your wings"
to help with the landing gear movement, and to allows for the down-lock to
actuate

Note that this system does not rely on hydraulic power to operate. The only
requirement is that mechanical power is used to operate the cut out valve
(usually available in the cockpit).

#### Pneumatic

In this system a compressed nitrogen bottle is used to force the landing gear
down to the locked position. Similar to the free fall procedure, the first step
is releasing hydraulic pressure in the locks to allow for gear movement. But,
for designs where the weight of the gear is not enough, hydrogen is discharged
pushing the gear down. Usually this system will allow to lock the gear down, but
won't permit such luxuries as closing the landing gear bay doors.
