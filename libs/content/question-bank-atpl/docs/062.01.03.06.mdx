# Factors affecting propagation

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.01.03.06.01** -- Define "skip distance": the distance between the
    transmitter and the point on the surface of the Earth where the first sky
    wave return arrives.
2.  **062.01.03.06.02** -- State that skip zone/dead space is the distance
    between the limit of the surface wave and the sky wave.
3.  **062.01.03.06.03** -- Describe "fading": when a receiver picks up two
    signals with the same frequency, and the signals will interfere with each
    other causing changes in the resultant signal strength and polarisation.
4.  **062.01.03.06.04** -- State that radio waves in the VHF band and above are
    limited in range as they are not reflected by the ionosphere and do not have
    a surface wave.
5.  **062.01.03.06.05** -- Describe the physical phenomena "reflection",
    "refraction", "diffraction", "absorption" and "interference".
6.  **062.01.03.06.06** -- State that multipath is when the signal arrives at
    the receiver via more than one path (the signal being reflected from
    surfaces near the receiver).
