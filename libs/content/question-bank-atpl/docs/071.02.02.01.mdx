# On-ground de-icing/anti-icing procedures, types of de-icing/anti-icing fluids

## Learning Objectives

1.  **071.02.02.01.01** -- Define the following terms: "anti-icing", "de-icing",
    "one-step de-icing/anti-icing", "two-step de-icing/anti-icing", "holdover
    time".
2.  **071.02.02.01.02** -- Describe "the clean aircraft concept" as presented in
    the relevant chapter of ICAO Doc 9640.
3.  **071.02.02.01.03** -- List the types of de-icing/anti-icing fluids
    available.
4.  **071.02.02.01.04** -- Explain the procedure to be followed when an
    aeroplane has exceeded the holdover time.
5.  **071.02.02.01.05** -- Interpret the guidelines for fluid holdover times and
    list the factors which can reduce the fluid protection time.
6.  **071.02.02.01.06** -- Explain how the pre-take-off check, which is the
    responsibility of the pilot-in-command, ensures that the critical surfaces
    of the aircraft are free of ice, snow, slush or frost just prior to
    take-off. This check shall be accomplished as close to the time of take-off
    as possible and is normally made from within the aeroplane by visually
    checking the wings.
7.  **071.02.02.01.07** -- Explain why an aircraft has to be treated
    symmetrically.
8.  **071.02.02.01.08** -- Explain why an operator shall establish procedures to
    be followed when ground de-icing and anti-icing and related inspections of
    the aircraft are necessary.
9.  **071.02.02.01.09** -- Explain why a commander shall not commence take-off
    unless the external surfaces are clear of any deposit which might adversely
    affect the performance or controllability of the aircraft except as
    permitted in the flight manual.
10. **071.02.02.01.10** -- Explain the requirements for operations in icing
    conditions.
11. **071.02.02.01.11** -- Explain why safety must come before commercial
    pressures in relation to de-icing and anti-icing of aircraft. (Consider time
    and financial cost versus direct and indirect effects of an
    incident/accident).
