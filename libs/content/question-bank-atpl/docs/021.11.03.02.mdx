# Engine control system

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.11.03.02.01** -- State the tasks of the engine control system.
2.  **021.11.03.02.02** -- List the following different types of engine control
    systems: hydromechanical; hydromechanical with a limited authority
    electronic supervisor; single-channel FADEC with hydromechanical backup;
    dual-channel FADEC with no backup or any other combination.
3.  **021.11.03.02.03** -- Describe a FADEC as a full-authority dual-channel
    system including functions such as an electronic engine control unit,
    wiring, sensors, variable vanes, active clearance control, bleed
    configuration, electrical signalling of thrust lever angle (TLA) (see also
    AMC to CS-E-50., and an EGT protection function and engine overspeed.
4.  **021.11.03.02.04** -- Explain how redundancy is achieved by using more than
    one channel in a FADEC system.
5.  **021.11.03.02.05** -- State the consequences of a FADEC single input data
    failure.
6.  **021.11.03.02.06** -- State that all input and output data is checked by
    both channels in a FADEC system.
7.  **021.11.03.02.07** -- State that a FADEC system uses its own sensors and
    that, in some cases, also data from aircraft systems is used.
8.  **021.11.03.02.08** -- State that a FADEC must have its own source of
    electrical power.
