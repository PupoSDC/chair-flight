# Primary flight display (PFD), electronic attitude director indicator (EADI)

## Learning Objectives

1.  **022.13.03.02.01** -- Describe that a PFD (or an EADI) presents a dynamic
    colour display of all the parameters necessary to control the aircraft, and
    that the main layout conforms with the "basic T" principle: attitude
    information in the centre; airspeed information on the left; altitude
    information on the right; heading/track indication lower centre; flight mode
    annunciation; basic T; take-off and landing reference speeds; minimum
    airspeed; lower selectable airspeed; Mach number.
2.  **022.13.03.02.02** -- Describe the typical design of the attitude
    information: artificial horizon with aircraft symbol; superimposed flight
    director command bars.
3.  **022.13.03.02.03** -- Describe the typical design of the speed tape:
    rolling speed scale with numerical read-out of current speed; limiting
    airspeeds according to configuration; speed trend vector; bug/indication for
    selected airspeed.
4.  **022.13.03.02.04** -- Explain the Mach number indications and how a
    selected Mach number is presented with the speed bug on a corresponding IAS
    on the speed tape with the Mach number shown as a numerical indication
    outside the speed tape.
5.  **022.13.03.02.05** -- Describe the typical design of the altitude
    information: rolling altitude scale with numerical read-out of current
    altitude; altimeter pressure setting; bug/indication for selected altitude;
    means of highlighting the altitude if certain criteria are met.
6.  **022.13.03.02.06** -- Describe the typical design of the heading/track
    information: rolling compass scale/rose with numerical read-out of current
    heading/track; bug/indication for selected heading/track.
7.  **022.13.03.02.07** -- Describe the typical design and location of the
    following information: flight mode annunciators (FMAs); vertical speed
    indicator including TCAS RA command indications; radio altitude; ILS
    localiser/glideslope and RNP/PBN, GBAS or SBAS horizontal/vertical flight
    path deviation indicator; decision altitude/height (DA/H).
