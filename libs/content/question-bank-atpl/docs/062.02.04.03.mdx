# Coverage and range

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.04.03.01** -- Explain why a ground station can generally respond to
    a maximum of 100 aircraft.
2.  **062.02.04.03.02** -- Explain which aircraft will be denied a DME range
    first when more than 100 interrogations are being made.

## Summary

PPPS = Pulse pairs per second.

Interrogation rates vary from 150 to 5 PPPS. With 150 PPS being used for
Aircraft in search mode and aircraft in tracking mode emitting about 20 PPPS. On
the other hand, a DME station is only to process 2700 PPPS.

If we assume that 95% of the aircraft are in the vicinity of a DME are in
tracking mode, and the remaining 5% are in search mode, we can conclude that the
DME will be saturated at 100 aircraft (`95 x 25 + 5 x 150 = 2650`). Keep in mind
this is not a precise value. If all aircraft are in search mode, the DME is
saturated the DME is saturated at 18 aircraft. If all aircraft are not doing
that many interrogations, one DME can satisfy the needs of hundreds of
interrogators. Regardless, 100 is a good estimate of the capacity of a DME.

If the DME is over capacity, the transponders with the highest power will get
replies. these are not necessarily
