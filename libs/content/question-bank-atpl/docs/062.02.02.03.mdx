# Coverage and range

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.02.02.03.01** -- State that the power of the transmitter limits the
    range of an NDB.
2.  **062.02.02.03.02** -- Explain the relationship between power and range.
3.  **062.02.02.03.03** -- Describe the propagation path of NDB radio waves with
    respect to the ionosphere and the Earth"s surface.
4.  **062.02.02.03.04** -- Explain that the interference between sky waves and
    ground waves leads to "fading".
5.  **062.02.02.03.05** -- Define that the accuracy the pilot has to fly the
    required bearing in order to be considered established during approach,
    according to ICAO Doc 8168, has to be within plus/minus 5 degrees.
6.  **062.02.02.03.06** -- State that there is no warning indication of NDB
    failure.
