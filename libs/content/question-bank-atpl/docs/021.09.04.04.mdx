# Electrical load management and monitoring systems: automatic generators and bus switching during normal and failure operation, indications and warnings

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.09.04.04.01** -- Give examples of system control, monitoring and
    annunciators using the following terms:
    - generator control unit (GCU) for monitoring generator output and providing
      network protection;
    - exciter contactor/breaker/relay for control of generator exciter field;
    - generator contactor/breaker/relay for connecting the generator to the
      network;
    - bus-tie contactor/breaker/relay for connecting busbars together;
    - generator switch on the flight deck for manual control of exciter
      contactor;
    - IDG/CSD disconnect switch on the flight deck for mechanical disconnection
      of the generator;
    - bus-tie switch on the flight deck with AUTO and OFF positions only.
2.  **021.09.04.04.02** -- Describe, for normal and degraded modes of operation,
    the following functions of an electrical load management system on ground
    and in flight using the terms in 021.09 04 04 (01.: distribution;
    monitoring; protection in the event of incorrect voltage; protection in the
    event of incorrect frequency; protection in the event of a differential
    fault.
3.  **021.09.04.04.03** -- Describe the requirement for monitoring the aircraft
    batteries.
4.  **021.09.04.04.04** -- Explain the importance of monitoring the temperature
    of nickel-cadmium and lithium-type batteries.
5.  **021.09.04.04.05** -- Interpret various different ammeter indications of an
    ammeter which monitors the charge current of the battery.

  <Text variant="multipleCorrect" select={4}>
    In regards to the Generator Control Unit, it can be said that...
  </Text>
<Option correct>
  Modern GCUs are provided with a permanent indication to record failures.
</Option>
<Option
  correct
  why="Dog Clutch release === disconnecting the CSD. This operation can only be performed manually by the pilot."
>
  All the commands originating form the Control panel are applied via the GCU
  except the dog clutch release.
</Option>
<Option>The GCU controls the AC generator voltage.</Option>
<Option>
  The APU provied the excitation of the AC generator as soon as the APU starts
  up.
</Option>

  <Explanation>
    A **Generator Control Unit** monitors the generator output parameters. If a
    failure state is detected, the only operation the GCU is able to perform is
    to disconnect the **Generator / Exciter / Field Controller Relay**, causing
    the generator output to fall to 0.
