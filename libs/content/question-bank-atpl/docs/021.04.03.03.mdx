# Anti-skid

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.04.03.03.01** -- Describe the operating principle of antiâ€‘skid where
    excessive brake pressure applied is automatically reduced for optimum
    breaking performance.
2.  **021.04.03.03.02** -- Explain that the anti-skid computer compares wheel
    speed to aeroplane reference speed to provide the following: slip ratio for
    maximum braking performance; locked-wheel prevention (protection against
    deep skid on one wheel); touchdown protection (protection against
    brake-pressure application during touchdown); hydroplane protection.
3.  **021.04.03.03.03** -- Give examples of the impact of an anti-skid system on
    performance, and explain the implications of anti-skid system failure.
