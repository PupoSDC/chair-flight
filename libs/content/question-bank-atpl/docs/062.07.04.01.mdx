# Performance-based navigation (PBN) principles

## Learning Objectives

1.  **062.07.04.01.01** -- Define "path definition error" (PDE).
2.  **062.07.04.01.02** -- Define "flight technical error" (FTE) and state that
    the FTE is the error in following the prescribed path, either by the
    auto-flight system or by the pilot.
3.  **062.07.04.01.03** -- Define "navigation system error" (NSE) and state that
    the accuracy of a navigation system may be referred to as NSE.
4.  **062.07.04.01.04** -- Define "total system error" (TSE) and state that the
    geometric sum of the PDE, FTE and NSE equals the TSE.
5.  **062.07.04.01.05** -- State that navigation accuracy depends on the TSE.

## Summary

### PBN errors

- **Path Definition Error (PDE)**: Corresponds to an error between the RNAV path
  and the path over the ground. This error arises from the RNAV system inability
  to accurately define the desired path. **If you were a RNAV system**, this
  error would be equivalent to you drawing a line in a chart that is not 100%
  aligned with the optimal path between 2 waypoints.

- **Flight Technical Error (FTE)**: Corresponds to an error between the aircraft
  flight path and the RNAV path. This error arises from the piloting performance
  of the aircraft or the autopilot system. This error is the difference between
  your actual flight path, and the line you drew on the chart before.

- **Navigation System Error (NSE)**: Corresponds to an error between the actual
  position of the aircraft and the position reported measured by the aircraft
  systems.

- **Total System Error (TSE)**: Is the sum of the 3 errors described above.
