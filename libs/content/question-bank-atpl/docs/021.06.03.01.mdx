# System components, design, operation, degraded modes of operation, indications and warnings

## Learning Objectives

1.  **021.06.03.01.01** -- Explain that a pressurisation and an air-conditioning
    system of an aeroplane controls: ventilation; temperature; pressure.
2.  **021.06.03.01.02** -- Explain how humidity is controlled.
3.  **021.06.03.01.03** -- Explain that the following components constitute a
    pressurisation system: pneumatic system as the power source; outflow valve;
    outflow valve actuator; pressure controller; excessive differential
    pressure-relief valve; negative differential pressure-relief valve.
4.  **021.06.03.01.04** -- Explain that the following components constitute an
    airâ€‘conditioning system and describe their operating principles and
    function:
    - air-cycle machine (pack, bootstrap system);
    - pack-cooling fan;
    - water separator;
    - mixing valves;
    - flow-control valves (outflow valve);
    - isolation valves;
    - ram-air valve;
    - recirculation fans;
    - filters for recirculated air;
    - temperature sensors. (Remark: The bootstrap system is the only
      air-conditioning system considered for Part-FCL aeroplane examinations).
5.  **021.06.03.01.05** -- Describe the use of hot trim air.
6.  **021.06.03.01.06** -- Define the following terms: cabin altitude; cabin
    vertical speed; differential pressure; ground pressurisation.
7.  **021.06.03.01.07** -- Describe the operating principle of a pressurisation
    system.
8.  **021.06.03.01.08** -- Describe the emergency operation by manual setting of
    the outflow valve position.
9.  **021.06.03.01.09** -- Describe the working principle of an electronic
    cabin-pressure controller.
10. **021.06.03.01.10** -- State how the maximum operating altitude is
    determined.
11. **021.06.03.01.11** -- Explain: why the maximum allowed value of cabin
    altitude is limited; a typical value of maximum differential pressure for
    large transport aeroplanes; the relation between cabin altitude, the maximum
    differential pressure and maximum aeroplane operating altitude.
12. **021.06.03.01.12** -- Explain the typical warning on a transport category
    aircraft when cabin altitude exceeds 10 000 ft.
13. **021.06.03.01.13** -- List and interpret typical indications of the
    pressurisation system.
14. **021.06.03.01.14** -- Describe the main operational differences between a
    bleed-air-driven air-conditioning system and an electrically driven
    air-conditioning system as found on aircraft without engine bleed-air
    system.
