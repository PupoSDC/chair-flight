# Consideration of propeller effects

## Learning Objectives

1.  **081.07.04.05.01** -- Describe, given direction of propeller rotation, the
    propeller effects during take-off run, rotation and initial climb, and their
    consequence on controllability.
2.  **081.07.04.05.02** -- Describe, given the direction of propeller rotation,
    the propeller effects during a go-around and their consequence on
    controllability.
3.  **081.07.04.05.03** -- Explain how propeller effects during go-around can be
    affected by: high engine performance conditions and their effect on the VMC
    speeds; loss of the critical engine; crosswind; high flap setting.
