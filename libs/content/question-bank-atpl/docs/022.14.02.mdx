1.  **022.14.02.01.01** -- Describe the purpose of an FDR and its typical
    location.
2.  **022.14.02.01.02** -- List the main components of an FDR: a shock-resistant
    data recorder associated with a ULB; a data interface and acquisition unit;
    a recording system (digital flight data recorder); two control units (start
    sequence, event mark setting); limited flight-deck controls, but includes an
    event switch.
3.  **022.14.02.01.03** -- List the following main parameters recorded on the
    FDR: time or relative time count; attitude (pitch and roll); airspeed;
    pressure altitude; heading; normal acceleration; propulsive/thrust power on
    each engine and flight-deck thrust/power lever position, if applicable;
    flaps/slats configuration or flight-deck selection; ground spoilers or speed
    brake selection.
4.  **022.14.02.01.04** -- State that additional parameters can be recorded
    according to FDR capacity and applicable operational requirements.
