    The key differential between our question bank and other solutions available is
    that our question bank is Free and Open source. The goal is to build a community
    of students and former students who wish to 'pay it forward' by helping us write
    and continuously review questions to make sure they are up to date.

    Today we are releasing one essential piece of the puzzle to make that happen.

The key differential between our question bank and other solutions available is
that our question bank is Free and Open source. The goal is to build a community
of students and former students who wish to 'pay it forward' by helping us write
and continuously review questions to make sure they are up to date.

Today we are releasing one essential piece of the puzzle to make that happen.

## Finding questions

In case you don't know it yet, you can [search for questions](/modules/atpl/questions).

Our entire question bank is free and open for you to explore. But not all our
questions are created equal. Some are better than others. Whenever you find a
question that could be improved... now you can do it by pressing the
[Edit](/modules/atpl/questions/QDL7KCZC7I/edit) button.

Our question editor is designed to be as intuitive as possible, but there are
still a few things you should know about it.

## Writing in Markdown

Our question text is written in Markdown. Markdown is a simple markup language
that allows you to write rich text in a simple way. If you are not familiar with
Markdown, you can learn more about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

You can also give it a go here:

```tsx eval
<MarkdownClientDemo />
```

## Adding and editing variants

Each question can have multiple variants, which are different ways of asking the
same question. In the main view of our question editor, you can create, delete,
and merge existing variants.

To get a better understanding of the features, we have prepared a quick video
showcasing what you can do:

```tsx eval
<video controls style={{ marginBottom: "20px", width: "100%" }}>
  <source
    src="/blog/002-question-editor-release/demo-video.webm"
    type="video/webm"
  />
</video>
```

## Providing Feedback

If you have any feedback, please let us know by either opening a
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/PupoSDC/chair-flight/issues). Alternatively,
we highly recommend you join the [ATPL 2020 Syllabus Discord](https://discord.gg/atpl).
This is not our official Discord server, but everyone involved in this project
hangs out there, and we don't yet see the need to create a Discord server of
our own.
