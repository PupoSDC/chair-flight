# Introducing Annex Search

Annexes are a center piece in all EASA exams. Finding them however, is not
always easy. We are introducing annex search to Chair flight as an alternative
way for you to find questions based on what annexes they included.

<br />

<AnnexSearch
  noSsr
  questionBank="atpl"
  forceMode="mobile"
  sx={{ height: 500 }}
/>

<br />

Unfortuantely, to make this work we had to change how we managed annexes
internally which will result in all your previously started and finished tests
no longer being available. Chair-flight is still in relatively early development,
and altough we prefer to avoid such breaking changes, they will sometimes are
necessary.

<br />

<Link
  href="/modules/atpl/annexes"
  display="block"
  color="primary"
  children="Search ATPL Annexes"
/>

<br />

**See you in the skies!**
