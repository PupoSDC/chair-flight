# Introducing Our New 737 Type Rating Theory Question Bank

We are thrilled to announce the launch of our latest addition to the question
bank family: the comprehensive 737 Type Rating Theory Question Bank.

With over 300 thoughtfully curated questions, this question bank is designed to
challenge and enhance your understanding of the 737's systems, procedures, and
aircraft limitations.

You can create a [new test here](/modules/737/tests/create).

export const InLocoTestMakeer = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const fallback = <Skeleton sx={{ height: 400, position: "initial" }} />

return (

<Sheet sx={{ p: 1, my: 2, height: 600 }}>
  <NoSsr fallback={fallback}>
    <Suspense fallback={fallback}>
      <TestMaker
        sx={{ height: "100%" }}
        questionBank={"737"}
        onSuccessfulTestCreation={(test) => {
          router.push(`/modules/737/tests/${test.id}/${test.mode}`);
        }}
      />
    </Suspense>
  </NoSsr>
</Sheet>
); }

<InLocoTestMakeer />

**See you in the skies!**
