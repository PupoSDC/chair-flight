# New A320 Question Bank!

Today we are adding a new question bank to our application. This time we are
showing some love to all aspiring A320 pilots out there.

<br />

This question bank is based on the official Airbus A320 FCOM and it is
available for free to all our users.

<br />

You can get started here: [A320 Question Bank](/modules/type)

<br />

**See you in the skies!**
