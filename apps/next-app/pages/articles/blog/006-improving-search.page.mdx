# Improving Search

Finding questions on the Chair Flight Database has now become both faster and
easier! We have added the ability to filter by subjects, learning objectives, as
well as the ability to specify what exactly you are searching for.

Since Demos are worth 1000 pictures, have a go at the new question search forsti
the ATPL module right here:

<br />{" "}

<QuestionSearch
  noSsr
  questionBank="atpl"
  forceMode="mobile"
  sx={{ height: 500 }}
/>

<br />

<Link href="/modules/atpl/questions" display="block">
  Search ATPL Questions
</Link>

<Link href="/modules/atpl/learning-objectives" display="block">
  Search ATPL Learning Objectives
</Link>

<Link href="/modules/type/questions" display="block">
  Search Type Rating Questions
</Link>

<br />

**See you in the skies!**
