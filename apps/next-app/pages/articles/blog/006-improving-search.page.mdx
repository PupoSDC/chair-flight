# Improving Search

Finding questions on the Chair Flight Database has now become both faster and
easier! We have added the ability to filter by subjects, learning objectives, as
well as the ability to specify what exactly you are searching for.

Since Demos are worth 1000 pictures, have a go at the new question search forsti
the ATPL module right here:

<br />

<QuestionSearch
  noSsr
  questionBank="atpl"
  forceMode="mobile"
  sx={{ height: 500 }}
/>

<br />

<Link
  href="/modules/atpl/questions"
  display="block"
  color="primary"
  children="Search ATPL Questions"
/>

<Link
  href="/modules/atpl/learning-objectives"
  display="block"
  color="primary"
  children="Search ATPL Learning Objectives"
/>

<Link
  href="/modules/type/questions"
  display="block"
  color="primary"
  children="Search Type Rating Questions"
/>

<br />

**See you in the skies!**

export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogPageLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPageLayout>
);
